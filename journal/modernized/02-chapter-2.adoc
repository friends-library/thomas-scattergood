== Visit to the Southern States.

His mind having been exercised with a prospect of paying a
religious visit to Friends and others in the southern states,
in the fourth month 1792,
he obtained certificates of the unity of his monthly and quarterly meeting,
and soon after proceeded to perform it.
From the memorandums made during the journey, the following are extracted:

"`Fifth month 20th, 1792.--Left my habitation,
after first sitting down and being favoured with a comfortable
opportunity with my family and several Friends,
who came to take leave of me,
and accompanied by a number of Friends went to the house of my companion,
Josiah Bunting at Darby, and attended that meeting, which proved a strengthening one.

"`21st.--This morning sat down with a number of Friends,
and were favoured with another confirming opportunity,
and a sense that we were in the line of divine appointment.
22nd.--To the youths' meeting at London Grove and lodged at Joshua
Pusey's. Here we met with our dear friend Sarah Harrison,
from whom we parted in near regard,
not expecting to see each other again for a considerable length of time,
she being shortly to embark for England.`"
He then attended Sadsbury monthly meeting, meetings at Yorktown,
and the quarterly meeting at Pipe Creek;--"`in all which,`" says he,
"`I was favoured with something to communicate;
and it has been a time of humiliation with me since I left
home--feeling a strong current of affection at times prevalent,
toward those I have left there, and the length of my present journey closely affecting;
but the Lord is good and bears up my spirit.

"`30th.--To the week-day meeting at this place, wherein I was led in an encouraging line,
particularly to the youth.

"`31st.--To Bush Creek meeting which was large,
and a number of other societies collected,
to whom my mind was drawn forth in gospel love.
Sixth month 1st.--To Fairfax, stopping by the way at Richard Richardson's,
and while sitting with them,
I had to look back and remember the time I was
there with Samuel Emlen and George Dillwyn,
and the deep sorrow I waded under; but this was a different dispensation,
wherein Jacob's acknowledgment, through adorable mercy was mine, and I had to mention it,
'The Lord was in this place and I knew it not,' 3rd.--To Fairfax meeting,
and although it was silent throughout, and painful and exercising in the fore part,
the latter part thereof was a sweet time of renewing my own strength,
wherein my dear wife and family, and very particularly my dear aged mother,
were brought into remembrance with fervent prayer on her account;
and the length and breadth of the land was opened before me,
with animating strength of mind to follow my great and good Shepherd.`"

Extract of a letter dated Fairfax, sixth month 4th, 1792.

"`I have not doubted the fitness of my leaving home,
neither the time nor the getting along so far,
although I travel in the usual poverty and blindness from day to day;
yet am at seasons comforted in the hope of being favoured to journey forward,
so as to secure the best of treasures, which is peace.
It is not the largeness of the offering, neither thousands of rams,
nor ten thousands of rivers of oil; it is not barely giving the first born,
or surrendering wife and children and all, but continuing in the Lord's will,
subjectly given up thereto, from day to day, which I have found to be my sanctification.
May the same good hand which has led forth and preserved me in a state of resignation,
be with you my dear companion, and support and succour in the needful time.
My heart at seasons when looking toward my dear family has been broken within me,
and secret breathings have arisen to the Strength of Israel,
for your protection and help as for my own, in this widely extended journey.`"

"`6th.--To South Fork meeting; the house could not hold near all the people,
and though there appeared much rawness,
yet strength was given to preach the word to some good effect, and we left them in peace.

"`7th.--To Goose Creek meeting, which was an arousing searching time, and I had peace.

"`9th.--To the quarterly meeting of ministers and elders, which was a close time,
but was favoured with peace.
10th, first-day.--Had an open good meeting,
as was also the meeting for business on the 11th. 12th.--The youths' meeting was large,
and an open relieving time to me.
I believe the Lord, who is worthy of all praise,
was near with a visitation of love to the people.
Visited a number of families here, and was at their weekday meeting,
which was an exercising time, under a sense of the low state of things,
but strength was afforded, after a time of waiting,
to labour honestly for the good of the members, particularly the airy youth.
While we were sitting with a family and some other Friends in the evening,
a few expressions impressed my mind,
respecting the care of youth and timely stretching the
line of discipline over transgressors.
When I ceased speaking, my mind did not feel relieved,
and it appeared to me that there were near the house some of a
different class from those I had been addressing,
and on opening the front door,
found the porch and steps round about crowded with most
of the young people of this licentious little village,
and it afforded an opportunity greatly to relieve my mind,
and so went home to our lodgings in peace.

"`14th.--To the Gap meeting, which proved a very open time;
my mind was affected in beholding the people along the road going to meeting,
as well as in the house, it not being large enough to contain them by much:
left this place in peace.
15th.--To Bullskin meeting, which, after the expectations of the people were starved,
proved through divine help, an open good time; a number of strangers being at it.

17th.--To a large meeting at Hopewell, which was low and discouraging in the fore part,
but through favour ended more solidly and well;
next day after a comfortable sitting with the family of children where we lodged,
set off to go over the mountains.

"`23rd.--To the monthly meeting of Redstone,
in which I was silent until near the close of that for business;
and then after a season of painful conflict,
I was favoured to relieve my mind in a remarkably close line;
and to my admiration it proved a baptizing season,
and I trust through the fresh extension of heavenly regard,
brought a remnant near one to another:
thanks be given to him who is worthy of the praise of his own work.

"`24th.--To Redstone meeting, which was large, and after a season of waiting,
I stood up with an opening, which appeared mostly for people of other persuasions,
as there seemed to be pretty many there, but found it hard work to get along,
and at length all closed up.
In this condition I quietly sat down, and passed the meeting through in silence.
In the afternoon met with a committee appointed in the monthly meeting yesterday.

"`25th.--A morning of close conflict, wherein all seemed closed up.
I could not see it right to appoint a meeting;
but in a season of inward retirement was favoured with resignation to my lot,
and after strewing a few tears was a little easier.

"`26th.--A morning of renewed exercise: no way opening to move forward,
which was trying indeed, when I considered the length of my journey from home.
Surely I had failed,
if a secret hope had not been granted that I should yet behold
the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
In this proving state, A. W. proposed to leave us and visit his daughter,
as no prospect of service seemed to open;
and almost immediately on his mentioning his thoughts,
there appeared a little ray of light arising toward two meetings on that side the river,
and I found liberty in my mind to send word to Friends and only Friends,
to get together at Fallowfield tomorrow, and on sixth-day at Westland.

"`Sixth month 27th.--Crossed the river to Fallowfield meeting, which was a laborious one.
I sat nearly or quite two hours before I could stand up; but it ended well,
after which I was much depressed.
Went home with Mary England and lodged.

"`29th.--Crossed the river again to Westland meeting,--
stopped by the way to see a sick friend,
which with some detention at the ferry caused us to be rather late.
The fore part of the meeting was trying to me,
although on my first sitting down there seemed something good spreading.
I sat nearly two hours before I felt the revival of
that which would enable me to minister to the people,
but it was vouchsafed in the Lord's time,
which may my soul be more and more engaged to wait for.
It was thought to be a good meeting and ended comfortably.

30th.--Went to Redstone meeting,
where I was favoured to relieve my mind in a close but tender manner,
and returned with a good degree of peace;
and after a religious opportunity with a number of
Friends went towards a little meeting near Beesontown,
with resignation to the divine will, either to go on toward the Alleghany,
or to labour further in this land.

"`Seventh month 1st.--This morning walked out into the field and woods,
and had to commemorate the Lord's goodness and love,
wherein my dear wife was brought into remembrance.
O Lord, my soul reverences your name,
in that you are pleased to accept the feeble efforts of an unworthy servant,
who desires to thank you for your mercies past,
and humbly to hope for the continuance of them, through this trying journey.
Be pleased to remember my dear family and friends left behind;--
graciously be near to my dear help-mate and my aged mother.
O Lord, look down in tender mercy on my dear children.
Went to this little meeting, held in a cabin about sixteen feet square,
without a window in it, and a very warm day; but through mercy it proved a good time.
After dinner my mind was closely exercised to know what step to take next,
and towards evening was easy to go to Beesontown;
this night was a wakeful conflicting one.

"`2nd.--Thoughtfully exercised to feel my way in this land: after breakfast,
taking a walk abroad, and seeing the reapers in the field of our landlord,
(who is a Presbyterian,
but his wife and several of the children of our Society,) my
mind was turned toward them in gospel love,
and when they came in to their breakfast and had done, I requested that they,
together with this large family would sit down quietly with me,
and to my humble rejoicing I had a good time with them,
from these words of Boaz to his reapers, 'The Lord be with you;' and they replied,
and 'may the Lord bless you.'
I now felt easy to leave these parts,
having laboured with much honesty and plainness amongst them;
and after dinner we rode to Samuel Morton's in the Alleghany mountain,
a place called Sandy Creek Glades,
where there are a few families of Friends and a little meeting,--a more wilderness,
desolate road or path, I think I have not travelled.
We got in after night, and they kindly entertained us.

"`3rd.--I went to the little meeting, held in a cabin about two miles off;
in as wild a place, I think as I ever was in.
In the fore part of it my mind was led to view the situation of our first parents,
both before and after their sorrowful fall,--how the ground was cursed
because of man's disobedience,--and that though they were few in number,
yet they were favoured with a merciful condescending
God to converse with and instruct them.
The wilderness and solitary place surely must have been
glad and rejoiced at such a time as this.
And O! gladdening thought, that the Lord is the same to day as then,
and remains so forever.
Praise him O my soul!
We went home with our friend John Smith, five miles,
by a lonely path through woods and glades;
and on parting from them the great Lord of the universe refreshed our souls
with living food from heaven--I have not often seen more brokenness;
and they remain as epistles yet to be read at this time.

"`6th.--A dull morning; my way being darkened and blocked up,
although I thought on the road yesterday,
that I saw it would be right for me to go on for Hopewell,
be there on first-day and come back to this place, Bear Garden, on second-day,
and so take the meetings hereaway next week.
But this morning all was gone, so concluded to move on,
but could not leave the family without a space of quiet retirement;
and after expressing what occurred to this family,
I thought we might pass on without a meeting;
but the opening returned with a degree of clearness,
and we gave liberty to notify the people of our being back on second-day:
wait the issue with resignation, O my soul!

"`8th.--Went to meeting at Hopewell, and was shut up in silence.

"`9th.--Attended Bear Garden meeting, which was exercising and laborious.

"`10th.--Attended Back Creek meeting, which proved a close and laborious season.

"`11th.--Poorly this morning; the weather close and warm,
which tries my poor feeble frame.
Inward provings also attendant, and the life of religion low.
O, that I may be preserved as well as those I have left behind,
from being swept away with the strong current in this day of outward ease.
My prayers have been put up this morning for myself and dear wife.
Lord keep us near to you, the fountain of strength,
and support in all trials of faith and confidence.
Went to the Ridge meeting, held in a school house, wherein I had close things to say,
but humbly trust I was in my place.
Had an increase of inward conflicts, but was favoured with a comfortable night's rest,
and in the morning (12th) with a degree of the overshadowing of the wing of divine love,
in a sitting with this family before we parted;
and on the road to a meeting called Tuscarora, felt brokenness of heart,
which seemed as a preparation for cross-bearing afterward, both in the meeting,
in which I was silent, and after it was over.

"`13th.--To Middle Creek meeting, which was made up, as I found afterward,
by a number of other societies, and it proved an open and I trust, through divine favour,
a baptizing time in the latter part.

"`18th.--To Crooked Run, a large, mixed, and open meeting;
in the close of which received a request from a
Methodist to have a meeting in a town called Font Royal,
about six miles off, to which after solidly weighing it, we consented.

"`19th.--To the meeting at Font Royal,
which was held in an unfinished Methodist meeting house;
it was hard work to preach amongst them,
and although life did not rise into such dominion as could have been desired,
during the greater part of the meeting, yet it was thought to end solidly,
and their preacher after meeting, came and taking me by the hand,
owned the testimony delivered.

"`20th.--After a remarkable opportunity with J. F.'s family,
set off and stopped at a poor man's house, with whom and his wife and eight children,
we had a religious opportunity.

"`21st.--A poor night's rest, and unwell this morning.
O! what a poor feeble creature I am, to move forward altogether amongst strangers.
This day a sore and long fit of sickness I had some years before,
came humblingly into view, and my covenant then made to serve and follow the Lord,
even to the end of the land.
Lord send forth your light and your Truth; let them lead me, let them guide me.
You can raise out of weakness and sickness into strength and health,
I hope and trust in you.

"`22nd.--Went to meeting, which was an open time, and after it felt comfortable.

"`23rd.--At Evan Thomas'; and it being a rainy day, staid mostly within doors;
as in the outward, so in the inward, it seemed a cloudy, dull time.
Attempted after dinner to set off and move forward,
but after sitting down with the family under a painful cloud,
in which I found nothing to say, had no liberty to move.
Wait in patience, O my soul.

"`24th.--After breakfast sat down with this family,
and was favoured to relieve my mind of an exercise which lay on it.`"

After visiting several families, he remarks;
"`My mind was sweetly comforted on the road after the opportunity at the last house;
but O the baptism I had to pass through on account of this family, in the evening,
night and morning; but found an opportunity to relieve my mind in a serious opportunity,
and then moved on toward the old settled parts of Virginia,
We missed our road and got lost, and about one o'clock came to a house in a lonely place,
where we sat down contentedly, as has been the case frequently,
and ate our cake with some butter and milk.
In the evening we sot over the Blue mountain, at Rockfish Gap, to a friendly man's,
where we were kindly entertained for pay; and in the morning when about to set off,
took a serious opportunity with him, wife and some of the family, much to my own comfort,
and it appeared to be to their satisfaction, and so moved forward in peace.
Yesterday crossed six or seven considerable waters,
and in the evening reached John Douglass', near Douglass' meeting: poor,
exercised travellers, what need we have of faith and patience.

"`27th.--To meeting,
and for a time I was almost ready to conclude we might leave them as we found them,
so little was to be felt;
but in the latter part strength was given honestly to discharge myself,
and felt peaceful and easy.
On our road afterward,
my soul praised the Lord for the extension of his arm of protection and deliverance,
for of late it has been a time of sore trial.
Had a comfortable ride, and when we arrived at E. J.'s,
he came and affectionately saluted us, and gave us such a hearty welcome,
poor pilgrims as we were, that it was truly comfortable;
for which I am thankful while penning this under his roof;
and yet desire to rejoice with becoming fear, seeing how good mortification,
poverty and abasement prove, when rightly submitted to and lived under.`"

In a letter dated seventh month 30th,
after speaking of a meeting which he held on the 19th, he says:

"`This is the first meeting out from amongst Friends,
and hope truth was not dishonoured thereby;
but it is not the line of service I have been led in, and am ready to think sometimes,
may not be much so in the course of this visit.
My cup seems full toward our own professors;
and if my religious communications are not in all
places so large as in some visits amongst other people,
I think my cup of suffering, in and under a sight and sense of Zion's desolate state,
is as large as ever I experienced, but the Lord, my helper,
has been kind beyond expression, and in a sense of it, at seasons we can say,
we lack nothing.

The way to have got over much ground, and made quick despatch in the visit,
I suppose would have been to pursue our route up the country to South River,
and from there to New Garden,
and also the way to have breathed a more pure outward air back of the mountains,
but that road was shut up, and a little light shone this way into a sickly country,
and at a sickly season.
Times and seasons, health and sickness, life and death,
are with the ever gracious Helper of all that trust in him,
and having put my (or our) hands to his plough, we may not look back,
and I may again say, with thankfulness of heart,
I rejoice that I am favoured with such a true yoke mate
in the various dipping seasons to be met with.`"

"`Eighth month 1st.--To Black Creek meeting, a mournful time,
under a sense of the low state of the church.

"`3rd.--Had a religious opportunity,
in which some of the poor negroes came near the door,
and my speech was turned toward them; they wept, and I was comforted in the belief,
that the visitation of God's love was towards them.
Leaving them in this tender frame of mind, we went to the preparative meeting,
held at White Oak Swamp.

"`7th.--To Wain Oak week-day meeting; and notice having been given in the neighbourhood,
it was pretty large, and thought to be profitable;
had a serious opportunity in the family where we dined,
with a number of neighbours who stopped; went on to Skimino,
and stopped at a friendly man's and lodged.

"`8th.--To Skimino week-day meeting; which was large, and an open tendering season,
which had a tendency to brace me up a little.

"`9th.--To James River, this was an exceedingly close warm night,
and trying to my weak frame, but I humbly hope all will work together for my good,
as resignation to the divine will is laboured after.

"`10th.--Spent the morning of this day in a comfortable degree of quiet,
after a tossing night, and feel desirous my love may increase to my dear Lord and master,
who has led me forth in his work.

"`11th.--Spent the morning of this day in a quiet sweetness;
went to the quarterly meeting of ministers and elders, held at Black Water,
which was a comfortable open time.

"`12th.--To a large and mixed meeting; the weather continuing exceedingly warm,
with the addition of very close exercise and religious labour, affected me much;
my appetite failing--but the Lord being good and gracious to me,
I was favoured with ease of mind, and in the afternoon also,
was helped to discharge my religious duty towards both
white and black of this family and others,
although to the spending of my bodily strength.

"`13th.--To the quarterly meeting;
found Friends in the practice of discouraging all but members attending on this day;
we did not sit long before the business of the meeting was opened,
and in the mean time I was favoured with a comforting season amongst them,
and also in the meeting for business;
I relieved my mind much to my comfort and satisfaction,
and trust to the edification of my brethren;
and in the evening a solid opportunity in the family of A. Bailey.

"`14th.--Set off accompanied by Jesse Copeland and Benjamin Pretlow,
to the Western Branch; a long trying ride, and no house to stop at but the meeting,
which although laborious in the beginning, ended comfortably.

"`15th.--To Bennett's Creek, where was a mixed large meeting, and an open time.
In the afternoon returned to a meeting held in Suffolk court-house,
where I sat almost two hours in silence, and was thankful for preservation;
and although no mighty works were done,
I was glad in feeling the good and preserving hand near.
Near the close had a little to communicate to the inhabitants,
and before the meeting ended, to the poor African race in particular,
a number of them being there; and left the place in peace.

"`16th.--We went to Summerton meeting, which was large,
the house not containing the people by many, and a pretty open time.

"`17th.--A cold night, and this morning sat by the fire.
To Johnson's meeting, where the expectations of the people appeared great.
I sat nearly two hours in silence, and had but a painful season at last.

"`18th.--To the widow Vick's, to the meeting held in her house, which was large and open.

"`19th.--To Black Creek, where we found a large mixed gathering of people,
more than the house could hold, and through the extension of divine strength,
was a good meeting.

"`20th.--To Stanton meeting, to which came many people,
as has been the case for several days past; and the weather was hot,
and the house close and crowded, and numbers out of doors,
yet I may not forbear recording the goodness of Israel's Shepherd,
who was as near to help this day as heretofore.
May praise be rendered unto him for this,
and for the preservation of my poor weak body through heat and cold,
watchings and fastings;
even to him who preserves his servants in burning climes and lands remote,
and supports them by his care.
With reverence I bow, in remembering that man is not to live by bread alone,
but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
O! dearest Master,
preserve me in watchfulness and humble thankfulness for your favours past and present.

"`21st.--A trying night, and felt unwell this morning, with but little appetite.
Went to the meeting called Seconk, which was crowded,
the house not being large enough to contain the people.
And O, how mercifully near was the Lord my God,
furnishing with strength to clear myself of the people;
there being a large collection of youth, and also others from different meetings,
and after it was over parted from several of them with brokenness.
In this day's work I have been wonderfully supported, seeing I was so weak this morning.

"`24th.--To Micajah Crew's;
and for the favour of being permitted to arrive again at this kind friend's house,
through such arduous labour as I have experienced since Black Water quarterly meeting,
I feel thankful, and recruited in bodily health and strength.

"`26th.--To the select quarterly meeting at Cedar Creek, which was a uniting season;
and at eleven o'clock, to a very large and mixed meeting,
wherein the Gospel of peace was preached,
and through its prevailing many were reached and tendered,
and my mind relieved and comforted.
Let the praise and honour of this day's work be rendered unto the Lord,
who is a present helper in the time of need.

"`27th.--To the quarterly meeting for business, which began at ten o'clock,
and held until near six.
This was nearly select, and an open time in the meeting for worship,
especially toward the youth, and I hope throughout it was a meeting to be remembered.

"`29th and 30th.--Spent these two days in an emptied state, seeing no way open to move;
and it has been a time of renewal of outward health and strength,
after such close labour in the heat of the weather;
it being now and for a week past cool and pleasant.

"`Ninth month 1st.--My mind was exercised this morning, not knowing which way to move,
or what to do.
O! what need is there of patience in such stripping seasons.
After dinner set off in much weakness toward Genito meeting,
accompanied by our kind friend Micajah Crew.

"`2nd.--To Genito meeting; and no notice being given, it was small,
but I was comforted in my present poor state therein.
Prayed for my dear wife, mother and children,
and was favoured with a small opening to move forward;
and after dinner had a little to communicate to a number of young people of the family,
and others who came to see us.

"`3rd.--Set off on our journey, and crossed James' River,
and staid all night at S. Pleasants', where we were favoured with a precious opportunity,
and I had a sweet refreshing night.
A measure of the same sweetness and love covered our minds on parting this morning,
and the savour thereof remained with me for some time.
Ate our dinners on the road, and in the evening arrived at our friend J. Johnson's,
at Amelia.

"`5th.--We were most easy to see the two or three families of Friends together,
in their tattered meeting-house, with an earthen floor, a habitation for hogs;
and although I went in weakness,
the presence of Him who took up his abode in a stable
and a manger (there being no room in the inn,) was near,
and favoured not only with strength to preach the gospel to a few,
but with a renewed prospect that the time will come,
that the wise will be confounded in their earthly wisdom, and, weary of it,
will be prevailed upon to follow Christ Jesus, the light of the world;
even so be it in the Lord's time.

"`6th.--We rode to an inn and lodged.
Ate some provisions we had with us in a poor house by the way,
and had some religious conversation with the woman, and set off well refreshed.

"`7th.--To our friend William Johnson's at South River, and lodged.

"`9th.--To Seneca meeting which was held in a log building without a window in it.
A close, hot time, as to the outward, and in an inward respect,
very little good to be felt amongst the people, either within or out of doors:
but being helped through my close and laborious exercise,
it proved at the close a solid refreshing time, I hope to more than myself.
Went home with R. B. and dined; here was but poor outward accommodations,
which to the flesh was trying;
but on parting was favoured with a precious opportunity with parents and children.

"`15th.--To South River monthly meeting, which held until almost night,
and was a satisfactory time.

"`16th.--To a meeting at the above mentioned place, which was large and favoured;
I felt great unworthiness, but the Lord was merciful;
went home with Joseph Anthony to a town called Lynchburg.

"`17th.--Here we tarried until about noon,
and several Friends came a number of miles to see us.
We sat down together with the family, and I trust it proved an instructive time.
We rode this day to a public house about twenty-seven miles.
Ate our dinners by the roadside, were well refreshed,
and in the evening my heavenly Master refreshed my soul in a plentiful manner.

"`18th.--This morning on parting we requested a religious opportunity with the family,
which was readily granted and proved a baptising season,
there being several other travellers with us,
among them two goodly Virginia gentlemen of some distinction;
after which I had great peace,--the Lord be praised therefor.

"`19th.--After some edifying conversation with our host this morning we rode to C. L.'s,
and next day after a baptising opportunity with
him and wife and also visiting the school,
which I believe was satisfactory to the master, though not a Friend;
we parted affectionately and went home with our kind friend Samuel Parsons,
who has been acceptably with us in this tour since we left his house.

"`21st.--Spent this day at our friend Samuel Parsons'; Thomas Pleasants coming to see us,
was favoured with a solid opportunity with him and wife, who were much tendered.

"`23rd.--To Genito meeting which was large, and I was much exercised,
and found it hard work to get relief.

"`25th.--I feel like a poor creature this morning;
nothing presenting with clearness to my mind,
and this staying in one place looks much like loitering away
time,--but time is the Lord's and his time is the best.
O my soul wait patiently for it, and when again opened into service be simply obedient.
After breakfast walked abroad,
and a prospect opened on my mind to visit a family and to
appoint a meeting at S. Pleasants' house at noon tomorrow.
On informing our friend Thomas Pleasants, it was readily complied with,
and he accompanied us to S. C's.,
where we were favoured with a baptising season together,
and next day went over the river to the meeting held in S. Pleasants' mill,
which was large;
but I did not find that relief and satisfaction of mind which I have in some places;
although the people appeared goodly and behaved solidly.

"`27th.--Went to Genito week-day meeting under close exercise of mind,
and as we entered the house found it almost filled up with people, which was unexpected,
not knowing how they got notice, or what induced so many of them to come together.
Great stillness prevailed, and my mind was so much humbled as to bring me on my knees,
after which I was favoured with an open time in testimony.
The Lord be praised for his goodness.

"`28th.--A night of exercise, and feel poor, blind, and unworthy this morning;
no way opening to move forward.
O what a great thing it is to keep always shod
with the preparation of the gospel of peace,
and not to transgress or break the least tittle of the law.
Truly I may not boast.

"`30th.--To Genito meeting, which was pretty large,
considering there is a yearly meeting of the Baptists' Society within six miles.
It proved an open relieving time; went home with Samuel Parsons,--took our farewell,
and came back with our kind friend Thomas Pleasants, where we met with a hearty welcome,
and my spirit was set a little more at liberty,
in a hope that way may open in the morning to leave this neighbourhood.

"`Tenth month 1st.--I feel this morning as though we might be released out of this place,
and know not that there is one stone left unturned with regard to anyone.
O that the Lord may bless the labour he has bestowed instrumentally on individuals,
to their growth in the ever blessed truth.
We left Thomas Pleasants' after another baptising tendering season,
wherein my dear wife and family came into remembrance,
and the Lord was prayed unto for the continuance
of his strength and love to us who are abroad,
and to those left at home, after which set off in comfort and peace,
and 'the trees of the field did clap their hands.'
We arrived at Richmond before night,
and on the 3rd set off accompanied by Samuel Couch and Robert Evans, pretty easy in mind,
and thankful that we could leave Richmond.
Arrived at our friend Robert's before night at Petersburg,
who with his wife and children received us with openness,
and after they had refreshed our bodies,
the Lord condescended to feed and refresh our better part together;
and I thought it was worth being shut up a day at Richmond in blindness,
and riding this thirtyseven miles for.
Went to bed easy and comfortable,
but my dear companion was taken very unwell in the night, which alarmed me.

"`4th.--Went to Gravelly Run meeting,
notice having been sent forward,--and it was a season to be remembered by me.
I could think of little in the forepart, but returning back to Richmond,
to which prospect I cheerfully resigned myself,
and was afterward favoured with an open time in the meeting.
We had a remarkable time at the house where we dined,
wherein I believe the strong was made to bow before Him whose power was eminently felt,
and after it went on peacefully to Petersburg.

"`7th.--Returned to Richmond and attended a meeting at the capital.
We received a respectful letter from the person who occupied the most convenient room,
excusing his not giving it up to us, as he was to preach a funeral sermon for a major,
on the death of his wife.
The meeting was not large at first,
and many of those who had gathered were uneasy with silence.
I felt willing, after a time, to get up and gently reprove them,
and commend the few who kept their seats,
and also invite them to come together in the afternoon and bring their neighbours,
thinking that would be all that would be required of me to say.
But when I began to speak, the people crowded into the house in such a manner,
as caused me to pause and consider,
whether it would not be best to sit down and recover strength
to labour amongst them in the line of the ministry;
but concluded it safest to endeavour to continue speaking,
and through favour I was in some degree enabled to relieve my mind,
and it was thought Truth arose and spread into some dominion.`"

In a letter to Hannah Cathrall, dated "`Richmond, tenth month 9th, 1792,`" he says:

"`We came into this place yesterday morning from Robert Pleasants', accompanied by him,
and although I feel a care on my mind respecting going too much to,
or being too free in the houses of disowned members or others not of our Society,
as has appeared so open hearted and friendly since our lot has been cast here,
I was free to stop at his door, and after meeting came back and lodged.
I have thought more of your lines,
since a proving dispensation I had to pass through yesterday,
than when I first received them;
and some of your expressions are as fitly framed as if you had been on the spot.
My beloved companion told me last evening,
that he thought of the bow and battle axe mentioned by you,
while your poor friend was exposed amongst a multitude of strangers,
in this dissipated city.
So it was in Boston, when I was under very deep conflict and exercise of soul,
your words through favour, were like apples of gold in pictures (or a basket) of silver.
But for all this, bear with me,
I have felt at times something rising up in my mind by way of rebuke against you,
under a fear that you do not sufficiently avail
yourself of that stretched out hand and arm,
which with such clearness and pertinence you can write of to others.
I want you, my dear sister, to fulfill or accomplish your task in the day time,
knowing that the Lord of the harvest has blessed you with a precious gift.
Is your bodily presence weak and your speech contemptible amongst the people,
or only in your own opinion?
There are many poor children crying for bread in places, and few,
very few delegated feeders or shepherds to administer to their needs;
and this thing is not of the Lord of hosts,
but I believe for lack of unreserved obedience in all things to his blessed will.
Therefore it is, that strangers have to stand and feed their flocks,
and the sons of aliens to be for husbandmen and vine dressers.
Lift up your eyes and behold what a field of labour there is;
and although deep are the plungings of the labourers, yet sweet is also, at seasons,
their reward; yes, it is preferable to an earthly crown.`"

"`11th.--Went to Curies meeting, which was small: I felt peace in going,
and comfort and satisfaction on sitting down in the meeting, in the remembrance,
that Truth will remain the same, although all men forsake it.
I laboured in weakness and poverty,
and although encouragement was held forth to the poor and needy,
yet it was afflicting to feel the irreligious spirit
that is so prevalent in this neighbourhood.

"`14th.--To a meeting in the Assembly room in the town-hall at Richmond, which was large,
and we had the company of many Friends from different parts of the country.
Dear T. Harris and wife came thirty miles; and to my great comfort,
dear Mary Berry came from Micajah Crew's, at Cedar Creek, twenty-two miles,
and arrived after the meeting had nearly gathered.
She exercised her gift, both in supplication and testimony, amongst a mixed people,
who behaved well, all things considered;
and after it was over we were treated with kindness by several.`"

Speaking of this meeting in a letter,
after stating that his beloved friend Mary Berry came in late, he says,
"`I cannot fully describe the feelings of my exercised mind,
when thus favoured with her company, and the help of her spirit.
Indeed I felt a degree of shame cover me,
in the remembrance of these expressions of the Master, 'O you of little faith,
wherefore did you doubt;' perhaps this was on the sudden
appearance or putting forth of his power formerly.
It was a large gathering, in which I was strengthened to stand forth in a good degree,
I trust, of innocent boldness, carefully leaving room and time for this beloved friend,
who appeared in prayer and afterward in testimony.
I may with gratitude say, the name of the Lord be magnified for his mercy,
and the stretching forth of his arm to help of late.

"`17th.--'To the meeting called Jack's Swamp; the fore part whereof was laborious,
under a sense of an infidel unbelieving spirit resisting the truths of the gospel;
and after the meeting for worship ended I was more confirmed in this belief.
However, I had a good time near the close of the preparative meeting with Friends,
both men and women, and the meeting ended with brokenness and tears.

"`22nd.--Got to the quarterly meeting for business at Contentney, in North Carolina,
which held until about sun-set.

"`23rd.--After a comfortable season in parting, set off the for yearly meeting,
and in the evening were refused admittance at a house of entertainment;
but riding a few miles further, we were taken in at a private house.

"`Eleventh month 3rd.--The yearly meeting of
North Carolina held until seventh-day evening.
We lodged at our kind friend Aaron Morris';
and the last night did not get home until late,
owing to one religious service presenting after another.
The service of the yearly meeting was laborious:
a lively spirited remonstrance was drawn and signed, to be laid before the Assembly,
respecting the free black people being taken up and sold again into slavery.
The yearly meeting was attended by a solid committee from the yearly meeting of Virginia,
and I trust upon the whole,
there was a moving forward in the great work of righteousness.

"`4th.--This morning awoke early, and my mind was impressed with a prospect,
which had at several times opened, to go toward the Western quarterly meeting,
and mentioned it to my companion, who united with it: so we got ready and set off,
after an opportunity with this kind family, and left them with sweetness.
Got to Little River meeting, which was a good one,
where we met with Mary Berry and her companion.`"

The following extracts are taken from a letter written to his wife, dated

"`Symons' Creek, North Carolina, Eleventh month 3rd, 1792.

"`You have often been the companion of my mind, my dear and tender wife,
since the receipt of your last letter, put into my hands at the yearly meeting;
in which I discovered that you were closely exercised, not only on my behalf,
but also on your own account, when reflecting on the frequent separation,
which is our lot in this uncertain world of losses, crosses, and repeated trials.
But let us remember that our Maker has declared himself to be our Husband,
our gracious Redeemer, the holy One of Israel; that is, to those who look to him,
trust in him, and lean upon his arm of strength and true comfort;
and that he is justly called the God of the whole earth,
who unites and knits our hearts together in the covenant of true love.
May this still be kept in view by us in this present separation,
that so we may be made a savour of life unto life, one to the other.
My heart was affected on reading your lines, and no part of them was more precious to me,
than your prayer for my preservation through the ups and downs which are to be met with.
There is frequently an echo of the same language in my heart,
and my fervent prayers both in private,
and also when favoured with the gift of utterance, have been poured forth for you,
my dear mother, and our children.
May your desire and care increase, in the best sense, toward these,
that it may please the Lord,
who often turns the feet of their exercised father from them,
to condescend to be their father and friend, and to make them truly his children.
As I am favoured to keep my habitation in the Truth,
which the Lord in his infinite mercy and love grant, through heights and depths,
both at home and abroad, may be my happy lot; next to this,
their walking in the Truth will be my greatest joy.`"

After mentioning some particulars of their journey from Richmond,
a distance of three hundred and fifty miles, he continues.

"`I have been favoured with a sufficient reward
for going round to Contentney quarterly meeting,
and can set my seal to the truth,
that the Lord is a rich rewarder of all that serve him in sincerity of heart;
and I have no doubt it is in his will also,
that our lot has been cast amongst Friends in this yearly meeting.

"`I have met with various occurrences since I left you;
had many long rides and close exercise of mind various ways;
but I am not disposed to give an evil report of such a journey,
lest I may unknowingly throw discouragement on the blessed work,
for truly in and through all I have met with,
the Lord has never failed to help with a little help,
and my exercised mind has at times been set at liberty in the gospel of his dear Son,
Jesus Christ, my merciful Saviour.
Therefore, my dear, give me up now into his further keeping and care,
for I know not when I may get through this journey.

"`I often call to mind the deep, and I was going to say,
horrible pit of distress and despair into which I was plunged,
and which you were a witness of, not many months after our marriage,
when the jaws of death seemed to open upon me,
and I was looking with deep thoughtfulness at the-house appointed for all living;
when fearfulness overspread me, under an awful sense that I was not in readiness.
Then, O then, was I willing to covenant with the Lord,
that if he would restore peace to my mournful soul and continue it,
I would follow him to the land's end.
No marvel, that since that day it should be my lot to be often engaged abroad;
and I feel sweet enriching peace of mind in a faithful
dedication of all that I am favoured with,
to divine disposal, however trying.
I have also received this assurance, that as there is a continuance in the same,
I shall not go without necessary outward good things;
and likewise as you continue in that which has hitherto strengthened
you to give your husband up to the all-wise Disposer,
to run with alacrity his errands,
you shall witness the blessing descending upon you in a way which, at seasons,
you can hardly believe.`"

Extract of a letter to John Hoskins, from the same place.

"`The situation of the poor blacks, who,
after being set at liberty by their conscientious masters,
have been sold again by wicked men under the sanction of a law of this state,
came before this yearly meeting;
and although a petition was handed the Assembly last year and rejected.
Friends were encouraged to move in it again;
and a committee of nine Friends was appointed to attend the Assembly this month,
with a lively, spirited remonstrance.
I have a hope that if they use endeavours in opportunities with the members separately,
when they go to Newborn, something more will be gained, favourable to the poor blacks.
There was a pretty large committee attended from Virginia yearly meeting,
respecting a junction with this,
but they proceeded no further than to leave it for consideration,
and appointed a committee to attend the next yearly meeting in Virginia.
My mind has been closely exercised on these two
subjects during the sitting of this meeting;
although neither I nor my father before me, that I know of,
was ever concerned with slaves;
neither has it fallen to my lot at home to speak much in meetings on their behalf.
It has not been so now; for while thinking, of such gross wickedness,
I have felt the fire to burn, which led also to speaking with the tongue.
And I think Friends have too much permitted their hands
to hang down with feebleness in this matter.`"

"`8th.--Went to Lewisburg to the house of a kind Methodist,
who would not take pay for what we had.
I was made sensible that religion had a place in his mind, and that of his wife,
almost as soon as I entered the house,
and we had a solid season with the family before we left them.

"`10th.--To the meeting of ministers and elders at Cane Creek.
In the ride this morning,
I remembered the helpless condition I was reduced to this time about nine years ago,
by weakness of body and mind, and now through mercy,
this twenty-six miles ride appeared little to me.
My heart was filled with gratitude to my merciful Lord and Master,
and although I have had times of suffering and proving in this country,
I have no doubt of being in the proper allotment.
But O, how the dispensation was changed in meeting!
Wait and hope, O my disconsolate soul, upon your Deliverer,
who never fails in the needful time.

"`11th.--A large meeting; but alas! what a lifeless one.
O! the rawness which appeared; there was not much room for public communication,
and but little was given to me; it was a suffering time.

"`12th.--To the quarterly meeting, which was an exercising, searching time;
and in the close I felt peace, especially at the conclusion of the select meeting,
which held after night.

"`14th.--This day begins our work in appointing meetings in this country;
notice having been given in the quarterly meeting until first-day week.
This was thought to be a pretty good meeting.

"`15th.--After a good opportunity in the family, we set off before the sun was up,
and rode to Spring meeting.
As our friend John Carter and I rode together, he informed me, that in his young years,
being visited by the day spring from on high,
he sought much to find a place of rest to his soul, and joined the Baptists.
After a time he grew dissatisfied with their mode of worship,
not feeling that peace which he was in pursuit of;
and one day after seeking the Lord with great earnestness,
and begging of him to show him whether that was the people he must join himself to,
he went to their meeting with a determination that if he felt
an evidence of the owning love of God to attend his mind,
he would submit to go into the water to be baptised, or anything for peace sake:
but on that day the preacher held forth such doctrine to the people,
that it turned him away from them, in his mind,
and led him more and more into a lonely seeking state.
At this time,
the little company of Friends in the neighbourhood had
grown so weak as to neglect their meeting,
and had given consent for the Baptists to hold meetings in their meetinghouse.
For some time his mind was impressed with an apprehension,
that it was required of him to go and sit down by himself in the meeting-house;
but he put it off, being ashamed.
At length he went by a private way and sat down alone and was greatly refreshed;
but he could not do it privately long, feeling a necessity to travel the road openly,
for his friends and neighbours used to wonder where he went in private.
One day in going to meeting he met with one of them, who asked him where he was going,
and he told him honestly, 'I am going to meeting:' 'strange,' says the other,
'what will you go there for?'
He left him, however, by the way, and had peace in the meeting.
Next time he went, seven of his neighbours hearing of his going, joined him;
and in process of time he was united to the Society of Friends:
zeal and religion revived amongst them, and there is now a large meeting,
called Spring meeting, which we were at today;
and this Friend is a valuable minister amongst them.
We had a favoured meeting.

"`16th.--To the meeting at Cane Creek, which, upon the whole was a good time.

"`17th.--To Rocky River meeting, which was large for the place,
the house could not hold the people, and it was an open encouraging time.
Several Friends came after meeting to David Vestal's, to see us,
and our parting was such a time of divine favour, as will not, I believe,
easily be forgotten by some.

"`18th.--Went to Nathan Dickson's, and when the hour for meeting came,
we were agreeably surprised to find his barn well accommodated with seats, etc.,
but it would not hold the crowd of people that gathered; many were out doors,
both sitting and standing; and through divine mercy it was a thorough, favoured time.
After meeting a man came to me with tears, and said,
'I know that the glorious and everlasting gospel has been preached this day,
although I am not of your profession,
and may the Lord bless and protect you;' or nearly to this purpose.
May the Lord have the praise of his own work, and flesh be laid in the dust.

"`19th.--To the meeting called Tyson's, held in a log house,
which was not large enough to contain the people, and an open time it proved;
many of other societies being here,
and I humbly trust the gospel was preached with some degree of demonstration.
Stopping at a house to eat some provisions which a Friend had kindly brought for us,
and several others also coming there,
I had another opportunity to preach the gospel of my Lord and Saviour,
and so parted from our kind and hospitable friends and
their sober neighbours with sweet peace.

"`20th.--At Holly-spring meeting, which was large,
and though exercising in the fore part, I hope it ended profitably.
After it, a gray headed old man came to me,
and asked whether I was of the family of the Scattergoods, in New Jersey;
and after telling him I was, and some little more conversation passing, he said,
'You have scattered much good today; may we keep it.'
May the praise, if any good is done, be rendered to the Lord,
to whom it is due for all his tender mercies.
On the 22nd attended meeting at Providence, and next day to Center.
In the evening Peter Dicks informed me,
that there were but four or five families settled near him, when he moved to this place,
about forty years ago.
They held their meeting first in a private house, then built a small meeting-house,
which is yet standing, and used for a school; and near it is a large meeting-house,
built within these few years,--and a large settlement of Friends.
He also told me, that at the time William Penn came the second time into Pennsylvania,
his grandfather was settled on Brandywine;
and on William's return from a treaty with the Indians at the forks of Brandywine,
for the land on this side of Susquehanna, called the Conestoga land,
he came to his grandfather's, and offered him and others a large tract of that good land,
for £5 the hundred acres, and left them to consider of it, which they did;
and after consulting, concluded to send him word they would not take it,
because it was so far back, that they thought it would never be settled,
and it would only be money thrown away.

"`24th.--Set off accompanied by our kind young friend Phineas Nixon,
who came to this place to conduct us to his house.
It was a precious ride to me, through a piney wilderness, particularly the fore part,
in meditating on the divine law.
This day saw a fine buck near the road-side, and part of a flock of wild turkeys;
and at a tavern by the way, a lad brought a fine buck on horseback out of the woods,
which had been shot.

"`25th.--To Back Creek meeting, which was very large and an open time.

"`27th.--While I sat in company and conversation at a Friend's house,
my mind was very suddenly impressed with weight and solemnity, and giving way to it,
my dear wife and family, and also companion's, and in a very particular manner my son,
were brought into remembrance,
and under a precious exercise of spirit I kneeled down and prayed for them.
I trust the Lord heard, and in his own time will grant the travail of my soul.
It was an hour of love and mercy,
and the sweetness remained on my mind along the road for most of the afternoon.

"`28th.--A morning of close baptism and exercise;
having very close things to say in the meeting at Marlborough,
but after it felt pretty easy, and several told me that what was said was to purpose.
Ah, what is yesterday's manna when gone!
It is not to be looked to or depended on to day,
but day by day we are to seek the daily bread.

"`Twelfth month 1st.--Went to Springfield monthly meeting,
where I was closely exercised in the meeting for worship.

"`2nd.--O how very close was the exercise of my soul at Deep River meeting this day.
It was a large assembly, and I sat long in silence,
but at length had to deal out doctrine to very gross conditions,
but was comforted in that a little food for the Lord's children, the sheep and lambs,
was at length given me.
Here I met with my old friend and father, David Brooks, and his wife,
who appeared glad to see me.
I have had close doctrine indeed to deliver in some of the meetings lately.
O merciful Father, preserve me from saying anything which may prove a burden.

"`3rd.--To the monthly meeting, which was rather a more easy time than yesterday,
and found considerable relief in my labour, although it was indeed close.
After night rode home with David Brooks, and found a comfortable habitation,
quite sufficient for a resting place for the traveller.
Both he and his wife gave me a hearty welcome,
and time passed away in the evening pleasantly,
while engaged in recounting the gracious dealings of a merciful God,
since we were together almost twelve years ago, in New England.`"

He then attended meetings at Muddy Creek, Upper and Lower Reedy Fork, Bull Run,
and the quarterly meeting at New Garden.
After which he remarks:

"`11th.--After a sweet and refreshing night's rest,
and feeling comfortable and easy in mind this morning,
I have sat down with thankfulness to the Lord my helper, and made this little record,
looking for baptisms and humbling trials, both inwardly and outwardly to succeed;
but may I humbly hope and trust in the arm of Divine strength.
At this meeting we had the company of a pretty
large number of Friends from Cane Creek quarter.
Dear old David Vestal, who has been as a father to me,
said on parting 'I am grown old and cannot do as I have done in younger life,
in going with and helping Friends; but I have felt such love towards you,
that I have thought some times I could almost run after you on foot.'

"`12th.--To meeting at Muddy Creek, which was large and laborious,
but was thought a profitable one, and solid in the conclusion.
My dear friend David Brooks stopped me in the meeting house,
and desired I would not be discouraged in low seasons, for he could inform me,
that the state of things had been spoken to.

"`13th.--To Blue Creek meeting, which was a humbling baptising time to me;
wherein I trust I was favoured to pour out my spirit in humble supplication,
and afterwards in testimony;
and I thought a state or states present were designed for the ministry,
or usefulness in the church.

"`16th.--To Westfield meeting, which was large and mixed.
I was much exercised in desires that there might be a quiet settlement among the people,
and got up to speak; but such was the instability manifested,
and the absence of life in the meeting, that I soon sat down,
and waded under a travail for an hour or more.
After this conflict, my gracious Master helped me to discharge myself to my own relief,
and I hope to the warning of some, and to the comfort and help of others.

"`18th.--Was at Deep Creek meeting, which was the most crowded we have attended;
the house could not hold the people by many,
and although it was very spending and laborious, my companion says it was a good meeting,
especially the latter end.
I was informed that George Dillwyn was the first Friend who had a meeting in this place,
and now they have requested to hold a monthly meeting.

"`19th.--This morning's ride has been a serious humbling one to me;
and after we got here my spirit was brought into great exercise,
in which I sat nearly an hour in much conflict, like one bound hand and foot;
but through the arising of divine love and mercy,
I was at length set at liberty to appoint a meeting.
The husband was prepared for the word of command,
for which my exercised soul had been also waiting;
and he soon went off to notify his neighbours; the daughter, about thirteen years of age,
as soon almost as I mentioned the liberty I felt to have a meeting,
said she did not doubt that the neighbours would be glad of it,
and with great cheerfulness mounted a horse, and went to give notice.
Soon after, we saw her aged grand-mother, a Baptist, who was here on a visit,
walking along a path which led into the woods, as briskly as a young woman.
O my soul, wait the issue of all this unexpected faith and love!
My faith and patience have been closely tried;
truly it is a precious thing to be passive and willing,
waiting the Lord's time for his holy will to be done.
Lord keep me in the way you desire I should go.

"`20th.--A mixed meeting of Anabaptists and Methodists: I sat long in silence,
and believe it was right to do so,
but at length my gracious Master appeared for my help and strength,
and it was thought to be a good time.
At the close, some of the people parted from us with the appearance of affection.

"`21st.--Proceeded on our journey by a way which none of us knew,
and after crossing the Catawba River got to a friendly man's house where we staid,
and I feel humbly thankful that my spirit is borne up and supported this evening.

"`22nd.--Sat down and was favoured in a solid opportunity with this family.
The elder boys brought my childish days into remembrance,
and I was engaged to direct their minds to more precious things.
While I was engaged in testimony, a stranger came in, whom I met with last evening,
soon after we crossed the river.
One of our guides asked him the way, and instead of giving a civil answer,
he was abusive, appearing to be somewhat intoxicated.
But he was changed before we left this family, for being about to mount my horse,
and offering to take him by the hand to bid him farewell,
he said he was going the same road, and wanted company.
Truth was over him, and he was a loving and useful man to us on the road all day.
Both Josiah and I had good satisfaction in endeavouring
to open the way of life and salvation to him,
and he acknowledged to the truth of it.

"`23rd.--We moved forward, and meeting with some difficulty in finding the road,
stopped at a Captain Mix's. I was comforted on entering the door,
in finding his wife with a good book on her lap;
we had some religious conversation with them, and when we were ready to go,
he told us we were welcome to put up and stay with him that day.
I felt much love toward him on parting,
for indeed he appeared a lovely sensible young man,
and I could not be easy without telling him my desire,
that the Lord would enlarge his heart in the gospel of his Son;
and on looking over the neighbourhood,
I felt an earnest breathing to the Lord of the universe,
that he would make way for the propagation of the gospel of peace, both here,
and unto the ends of the earth.
We found the way to the ferry at Broad River with difficulty;
and the boat had been brought to the side on which we were by some young people,
who were gone a distance off.
A woman on the opposite side told us we might ferry ourselves over;
and Josiah and I undertook it.
Here we fed our horses and ate our dinners on a stump, and after the company had set off,
I had to turn back and open to the woman who directed us over,
that passage of our dear Lord's conversation with the Samaritan woman.
She appeared glad of the freedom I took in explaining it to her understanding,
as was also a younger one, who stood by her.
Many doubtless are the scattered sheep,
without an outward shepherd rightly to direct them.
Soon after we left the ferry, it began to rain,
and we stopped at a house by the fording place over Packolet river;
and after some pleading, Josiah and I got entrance,
the Friends in company with us going back about a mile with our horses.
We were taken into a weaving room, with a little fire on the hearth,
where we sat contentedly drying ourselves, not knowing:
where we might be permitted to lay our heads this night.
After a while we were conducted into another room, with an earthen floor and a good fire,
where we ate our suppers.
Although the man gave us no great expectation, yet we were furnished with a bed;
in the morning he went to the river with us, to direct us over the ford.
I parted from him in the love of the gospel,
after being engaged to open some of the truths of it to his mind.

"`25th.--A prospect of labour opens within Bush River quarter.
Lord keep me, and preserve me in patience, devoted in heart to do your blessed will.

"`27th.--To Paget's Creek meeting, which was large, but long in gathering;
and when mostly settled, a rude company came past and disturbed it.
Yet through favour we had a pretty good meeting afterwards.

"`28th.--This morning after breakfast, our friend John Clark called for us,
and after a sweet opportunity in the family, we proceeded toward Rocky Spring.
It began to snow about three hours before day and continued until about noon,
the bushes and trees were loaded with it, and the way was very difficult; nevertheless,
it has been a day of favour to me--for although
I ate nothing but a piece of cake for my dinner,
and a drink of water by the way,
through the extension of divine love shed abroad in my heart, all was pleasant.
My dear and precious wife was brought very near in spirit,
and my prayers were to the Lord, who had so mercifully opened to me the fountain of life,
that she might be a sharer in the same.

"`29th.--A very cold night, water froze to a considerable thickness on the table.
Had a suffering time both inwardly and outwardly at the monthly meeting at Bush River,
from which we went home with Isaac and Charity Cook.
Ah, what a poor unworthy slipping creature I am; may care and circumspection be renewed,
so that I may know preservation from secret faults.
I am in heaviness this evening, not so living as I ought.

"`30th.--Another very cold night and a suffering one; it would not have been so,
if the deceiver and deceit had been more narrowly watched against.
Lord Jesus forsake me not in my labour and travail in this remote land.
Went to Bush River meeting, and although it was long in gathering,
and the minds of the people for a considerable time unsettled;
yet we were at length I trust favoured,
and my mind opened to deliver some weighty gospel truths.

"`31st.--Set off early this morning for Mudlick meeting, accompanied by Isaac Cook.
A poor little company collected, but we fared much better than I expected.

"`First month 1st, 1793.--To Raban's Creek meeting,
held in a poor house with an earthen floor,
which was damp with the beating in of the rain and snow.
I thought on sitting down that it seemed a very poor beginning,
but I was enabled to preach the gospel amongst them, and came away easy.

"`2nd.--After riding all day, we lodged in a little cabin, and met with Samuel Pearson,
who expects to go with us to Georgia.

"`3rd.--Went to meeting at Allwood's very poor, and continued so for a season,
but to my admiration my heart was greatly enlarged in gospel love, and my mouth opened,
and trust it proved a profitable season;
after which we proposed to get on our way ten or twelve miles,
but I was discouraged on account of my feebleness,
and concluded to take an early start in the morning.

"`4th.--Arose before daylight, and proceeded on our way;
stopped in the woods twice and fed our horses; crossed Savannah river,
which is three hundred yards wide, at M'Koy's ferry, and also Little river.
The sun shining in our eyes,
for some time we could not see the landing place on the opposite side;
and being strangers to the ford, we did not go right,
and I have not been so much tried in crossing any water since we left home.
My heart is thankful for this preservation,
and for the many others we have through mercy experienced.
Travelled most of this day along a lonely desolate path,
with notched trees for our guide, and but few inhabitants by the way;
arrived at our friend William Farmer's about sun set,
and think we must have rode nearly or quite forty-five miles.
This kind man met us at his gate, and upon querying whether he could take us in,
his habitation looking so small, he cheerfully answered, he had feed for us and horses,
and would do as well as he could for us.
This is the smallest house I think I remember to have been in;
but we were favoured with enough--his heart is larger than his house.
He told us that four years ago, when he settled here,
his wagon was their dwelling place for some time;
at first ho built a little bower or tent, but a storm blew off the roof,
and they took again to the wagon for shelter.

5th.--To the monthly meeting of Wrightsborough; on the way and in the meeting also,
my mind was under close conflict, and I felt spiritual death increase on me,
and told my companion on the way,
that if my friends did not rise up in spirit and help me,
I feared I should sink and do nothing amongst them.
Thus I continued for a time in the fore part of the meeting;
having to look over my stoppings along in this journey,
also to remember the hand of my God upon me nine years
ago in sickness and deep affliction of soul,
wherein I was made willing to follow Him for the sake of his divine presence;
who then was mercifully pleased to hear my groans,
and take my engagement to answer the debt, when called upon.
Under a sense of his protecting care and divine providence,
in leading and also feeding me,
and having enabled me to reach that part of these southern lands which was then shown me,
my heart, in the midst of my afflicted state, was broken; and after venting a few tears,
I was willing to close this silent part of the meeting.
Friends proceeded to their business, and alas! how I was disappointed.
Often on the way I was pleasing myself with the prospect of getting amongst a tender,
hopeful people, who would receive me with open arms,
and that I should visit them from family to family; but instead of this,
I do not remember to have had closer things to say in any meeting.
My spirit was oppressed and grieved;
but having with honesty endeavoured to discharge my religious duty, I felt peaceful,
and we returned to our friend John Embree's, who received us kindly,
where I feel much relieved this evening.

"`6th.--Felt much at liberty in my mind this morning,
which continued on the way to meeting,
and I thought it was likely I should be favoured with an open relieving season;
but on the contrary, I sat the meeting through in silence,
and at the close told the people who were not of our Society,
that I felt much love toward them, but had not so learned Christ as to tell the people,
like some, to come together and that there would be preaching on such a day,
and that in a time of spiritual poverty I dare not put forth my hand to steal.
I then requested that they would leave me with Friends,
for I wanted to see them together, which, after a time, was mostly complied with,
and I had a close searching time with the members of Society;
a number of whom gathered about us after the meeting broke up, and were loving and kind.

"`7th.--O, the conflicts of my soul last night and this morning,
in which dear Josiah was my companion.
I hope the Lord, in his wisdom and love,
baptised me measurably into a feeling of the death and sufferings of my Saviour,
and thereby caused a willingness still to follow Him in the way of the cross.
'Know you not, that as many as were baptized into Jesus Christ,
were baptised into his death.'
We had a solid opportunity in this family, and then joined by a number of Friends,
went to an appointed meeting at William Farmer's,
who met us about five miles from his house,
and told me he had been up since about midnight,
providing seats and fitting up a shed to hold the meeting in.
He met me in a broken and tender manner; and the prayer of my heart was,
that according to his faith in God, so might it be done for him.
It proved a good meeting, as appeared by the brokenness of some,
both in the meeting and afterward; although there were some who laughed and jeered,
who were sharply reproved.
A number of the neighbours came back in the afternoon,
amongst whom we had a precious season,
and they parted from us with the desire that the Lord might go with us.

"`8th.--Set off at daylight accompanied by our friends James Galbraith and Samuel Pearson.
William Farmer and his brother Benjamin,
also went as far as Little River to see us safely over that difficult ford.
After crossing the Savannah river,
we stopped at the ferry house and refreshed ourselves with provisions we had with us,
and fed our horses.
I proposed to the landlord to see his family together in a religious way;
which was readily granted, and we were taken to a house at a small distance,
where we found his wife sick.
The family were soon gathered, and I had an open time amongst them,
which appeared to be much to the satisfaction of the parents.

"`9th.--Stopped and had a meeting with the scholars in the meeting or school-house,
which afforded peace to my mind;
and I had a sweet and comfortable ride most of the morning
through the wilderness--crossed the Saluda at the island ford,
which was somewhat trying, but got safely over.

"`10th.--Feel better in health this morning, after a comfortable night's rest;
went to the week-day meeting at Bush River, accompanied by dear Mary Pearson,
who came before breakfast to see us.
It was a conflicting silent meeting.
O, the death and heaviness which overspread my mind this day, and continues this evening;
I do not feel strength enough to appoint a meeting here tomorrow;
therefore wait in patience, O my soul, under the baptism of death.

"`12th.--Went to the meeting of ministers and elders;
where we met with dear David Vestal and his companion,
on a religious visit to these parts.
It was an exercising time to me, and no opening to labour in the fore part;
but I hope we were afterward profitably in our places, in the business of the day.

"`13th.--To a very large and laborious meeting at Bush River,
the house not containing the people.
The wicked, unruly, and dissipated ones were warned;
and I hope the seeking traveller encouraged to hold on his way.
I was much spent, and after taking some refreshment,
laid down under exercise and conflict of mind, being tried ever since we left Georgia,
with a prospect of returning back,
and through favour there is a willingness begotten to be obedient,
and to do all that my good Master may open and qualify for.
O, my soul, your dwelling has of late been as amongst those who kill the divine life;
hope and trust in the Divine arm, to be carried through;
that arm which has hitherto at seasons been made bare for your help and deliverance,
and by which the mouth of the murmurer and complainer has been stopped;
and this is cause of thankfulness.

"`16th.--A rainy day: kept house and employed myself in reading, writing,
and looking over letters from my dear family and friends, who have sympathized with me:
and although it has been, in some degree, a quiet improving day, nevertheless,
I am a poor servant; yet hope for more favoured times.
Is not all good which is ordered in divine appointment?

"`17th.--Set off this morning after breakfast, and it has been a peaceful day,
although turning my face from home.

"`18th.--Accompanied by our two Friends Marmaduke Mendenhall and Richard Batten,
with David Vestal and his companion, and Benjamin Farmer, we got well over the waters,
though we had to ride about ten miles round in order to
avoid Little River ford and find a good bridge.
Reached our friend Benjamin Farmer's cabin in the
evening--and although I felt poorly most of the day,
and under some discouragement,
nevertheless my mind was supported and borne up through all.

"`19th.--Lord, why should such a worm as I am, murmur or complain,
when you in infinite love condescended to dwell on earth;
condescended to men of low estate, and took up your abode with the poor of this world;
thereby to set all your servants an example of humility and lowliness.
O, how sweet is your presence,
whether experienced in the habitations of the rich or of the poor,
or in the wilderness and lonely places.
How are your servants blessed, O Lord, who are favoured to cast their care on you.
Went to a meeting at William Farmer's, held in his new unfinished cabin,
which he had fitted up for the purpose, and upon the whole it was a commodious place;
this meeting was appointed by David Vestal and Isaac Wilson, his companion;
I had some service in it.

"`20th.--After breakfast, came ten or fifteen Friends and friendly people,
from Farmer's settlement, on their way to meeting, most of them on foot,
having walked eight or nine miles.
It rejoiced me to see their zeal; and after we were gathered, it was a large meeting,
more than the house could contain, and I was, for once in this place,
favoured with an open and measurably relieving time, for which I was thankful.
It is eight months this day, since I left my dear wife, mother and children,
and the tender solicitude of my heart goes forth on their account.
May divine mercy and kindness be near and bear up the spirit of my dear companion,
and as he is doing and has done of late for me, so also to remember her,
and make hard things easy and bitter things sweet.

"`21st.--To a large and mixed meeting, held at the house of Marmaduke Mendenhall,
which was pretty laborious, but hope there were some tender minds.

"`22nd.--Unwell, but peaceful and easy.

"`23rd.--Enter my forty-fourth year,
(O. S.) and I have been favoured since I awoke from sleep,
with a little space of sweetness of mind in quiet.
O precious stillness, how good it is!
Rode to meeting, and such was my feebleness that my knees trembled under me; but,
thanks be to Him who is ever worthy, it proved an instructive time to seeking,
sober inquirers;
after which we requested the active members of our Society to stop with us,
and had a searching time among them;
some were disposed to confess their faults one to another,
and I hope things are on the mend: but O,
what conflicting seasons I have to pass through in this place.

"`24th.--Spent this day at our friend Daniel Williams' in an exercised state of mind,
and feebleness of body.

"`25th.--A morning of close exercise of mind,
but no opening to any religious service amongst Friends; it would be pleasant,
through divine help, to be favoured to break a little portion of bread,
after it is blessed.
It is a trying state, not to know where to go or what to do.
'Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,
but the Son of Man has not whereon to lay his head.'
If it was thus in the green tree, the Son and Heir of all things, wait in patience,
O my soul, under every painful dispensation, that so,
having fellowship with your Lord in suffering, in the day when he shall appear,
you may be prepared a little to rejoice with him; who, when he comes,
rewards amply for all our suffering.
After breakfast walked out into the woods under thoughtful exercise,
and on my return found J. E. in the house,
with whom my companion and I had a solid conversation.
He acknowledged with tenderness,
his gratitude that the Lord had turned us back amongst them,
and that we had been made instrumental in the hands of Christ,
to open the prison door for his enlargement.
He said that our turning our backs on them,
appeared like shaking the dust off our feet against them, which was affecting.
My spirit felt a little revived, after encouraging him in the way of peace.

"`26th.--Spent this day in no small affliction,
feeling as in an imprisoned state--seeing nothing to do,
and so far and so long from home.
O for patience and resignation in this proving condition.
Not my will, O gracious Lord and Master, but yours be done.

"`27th.--Went to meeting, and sat for a time under conflict,
but at length was opened and favoured measurably to relieve my spirit,
in a close and searching testimony.
It was again a crowded meeting.
After which I had to return to my former state of trial and pain of mind.
I remembered Samuel Bownas, who speaks of the same being his experience.
I believe mine is on account of, the state of things hereaway, or at least measurably so:
who can rejoice when the seed (Christ) is under oppression in professors and profane.
O! what a wicked spirit has reigned in these southern lands,
and what a lack there is still amongst all sorts of people,
of honouring the God of their life, breath and being!
Went home with Francis Jones;
in the evening we were favoured with a precious baptising opportunity in this family,
with a number of the children, and afterwards my bed was made sweet and easy to me,
although unwell.
The Lord be praised for his preserving care, which keeps the poor tossed mind in patience.

"`28th.--Spent part of this morning in walking abroad, and part in reading.
It is a warm day, in which the frogs are tuning their notes of praise,
answering the end of their creation.

"`29th.--A wakeful night, in which my home was brought nearly into view.
Surely I should faint,
if it were not that there is a grain of living
faith preserved in this poor earthen vessel.
I felt weak in body and exercised in mind, after I arose from my bed.
Lord Jesus,
shall I again witness times of greater confirmation in
the way and work to which you have,
in unsearchable wisdom, appointed me!
Wait in patience, O my poor tried soul, even in the deeps.

"`30th.--The meeting today, in the fore part, was a time of serious looking back,
and retrospection into my conduct in days past.
When the Lord humbles the creature,
and gives it clearly to see its own insufficiency and need of superior aid,
how it hides pride.
Before the meeting closed, I imparted some of my feelings,
and thought I was dipped into the states of some,
to their encouragement in the way everlasting.
My bodily strength is renewed, and I am more easy and quiet in spirit,
for which favour I feel thankful in heart to the Preserver of men.

"`Second month 1st.--Went to J. J.'s,
and was favoured with a comfortable sitting with these young married persons;
left them with sweetness and peace and went to S. M.'s,
where we had a religious opportunity,
which I hope will not soon be forgotten by either parents or children.
This family, amongst many others in these parts,
were robbed and spoiled in the time of the late war.
Their house was burnt, and one of the children told us,
that a man who was instrumental in spoiling their goods,
was at meeting last fourth-day week, in which I had to speak to murderers, thieves, etc.,
and pointed out to them the necessity of endeavouring
to do all in their power to make restitution.
The child observed that he seemed much brought down, and his lips quivered.

"`3rd.--Went to meeting, which was a pretty open time,
and when it was over Friends took an affectionate leave of us.`"
After a religious opportunity which he had with an individual, he says:
"`O what close things escape my lips.
Lord, I am in your hand; purge me from all the dregs of malice or bitterness,
and look down in mercy on this family.
When we were about leaving them, N+++_______+++ took me aside to speak to me;
and as I had told them I stood open to hear anything they might have to say to me,
and now was the time if they had anything to object against my conduct,
and not when we were gone--I thought he was going to make some objections,
but instead of that, he freely confessed that he had done amiss in several respects,
and acknowledged that I had been made, in the divine hand, an instrument of good to him;
'for,' said he, 'I have been a wicked man.'
This youth with others had been the cause of much grief
and exercise to my mind in the first meeting we were at.
I now parted from him in tenderness and love,
and he desired I might remember him when far separated;
and their younger brother on parting, also told me in an affectionate manner,
that he was never more glad to see any body in his life,
than he was to see us on our return to his father's:
we left them with good desires and went home with F. J. and lodged.

"`4th.--We had a solemn affecting parting time with Friends
and others;`"--and after visiting several families,
in which religious opportunities occurred, he remarks: "`Went peacefully to rest,
and for the favours of this day I bow in thankfulness to the Lord.

"`5th.--Found a Friend in the house when we arose,
who came seven miles this morning to see us.
O how precious is true love manifested by the poor amongst men--the
widow's mite was precious when seasoned with this.
Called to see a Friend and his wife who were sick, and had a pretty open opportunity,
in the close of which I kneeled down and prayed
to the Almighty to preserve my dear friends,
and also to look down in mercy upon the inhabitants of Georgia;
and felt peaceful and easy after parting from several of my friends here:
got into Augusta before night.

"`6th.--Looked carefully over this town in love,
but did not see that it was required of me to call the people together.
After we had parted from our friends at the bridge,
and got over on the other side of the Savannah river, I saw a company of black people,
men and women, with hand barrows, making a large causeway to the foot of the bridge.
I felt pity flow in my heart toward them, and made a stop and asked them how they did.
My heart was enlarged to preach the gospel as I sat on my horse, to the poor,
who received the sound thereof with tears and brokenness,
and my mind was sweetly comforted in parting from them.

"`7th.--Reached Isaac Cook's; and on the 10th attended Bush river meeting,
which was a large and mixed one, very irregular in gathering,
and unsettled in the fore part.
My companion had something suitable to say to them,
and afterward I stood up and laboured zealously and honestly,
to the ease and peace of my mind.
More relief and sweetness graciously afforded, and the way to move forward seems opening.

"`13th.--To Rocky-spring meeting; which was large and mixed.
A number of Anabaptists came to it, and the universality of the love of God,
and the one true and saving baptism were preached to the people.

"`14th.--Accompanied by several Friends,
we arrived at J. G.'s on the road leading to Charleston,--on the 15th,
after a seasonable, and may it prove a profitable opportunity with part of the family,
pursued our journey through a wilderness country and got to a house kept by a German,
where we made out pretty well, and set off peaceful and easy in mind,
after taking an opportunity to express to him what weighed on my mind,
concerning a future state, slaves, etc.
Stopped by the way and fed our horses, and while they ate,
we also partook of some food,--the ground being our table, as it frequently is,
or else a stump or log.
Provision, however simple or humbly spread, eats sweet to the contented mind; yes,
a contented mind is a continual feast:
the Lord be praised for the many mercies received since I left Georgia;
and may I stand girt about, and prepared for further suffering for the Seed's sake.

"`17th.--Went to Edisto, a little meeting of a few Friends and friendly people, who meet,
but have not the consent of Bush river monthly meeting;
yet we were free to stop amongst them,
and such neighbours as inclined to come and sit with us.
We got to the meeting about eleven o'clock,
but it was not fully gathered until one o'clock or near it, and held until three;
and it was five before we got any dinner.
This has been frequently our lot in these parts, which is spending to the body,
but mercy and kindness follow us, which has borne up my mind under exercise this day,
and I feel peaceful and easy this evening.

"`19th.--Got into Charleston, and on the 20th went to the week-day meeting,
where was a little company, and I had but little to say.`"

In a letter dated Charleston, second month 19th, 1793,
after describing the many privations which they experienced,
in travelling through a country where there were no regular taverns or dwelling houses,
he alludes to their having to go back into Georgia.

"`I wrote you from Augusta that we had to go back again almost one hundred miles,
to Georgia.
I saw it before we left Georgia, and was concerned about my dear companion;
but the blessed Master who has united us truly together as yoke-mates,
gave him also to feel the concern,
and when I hinted on the road that perhaps we should have to return,
after the quarterly meeting of Bush river,
he quickly answered that it was what he expected.
Indeed he was deeply dipped into sympathy with me in that place,
insomuch that he told me he felt almost as if his natural life must go,
and was pondering in his mind what would become of me.
This was joyful to me,
because I found we were baptized by the same spirit into one living
concern for the resurrection of life and the increase of it,
amongst the people; and such baptisms make near and dear one to another.
We not only left Georgia, but also Bush river, with sheaves of peace in our bosoms.`"

"`23rd.--O my poverty and weakness!
Where is the righteous man to stand in the gap?
yet I hope there is a seed preserved even in this wicked place.

At Charleston, under date of second month 23rd, 1793,
he wrote the following letter to his beloved friend John Pemberton.

Thomas Scattergood to John Pemberton

"`I received your letter dated eleventh month 26th,
on the day after our return from Georgia to Bush River: it met me at a seasonable time,
and the contents were then, and continue to be,
as the oil of joy and consolation to a poor and often mournful soul.
I have passed through very close exercise, and my path has been deeply proving,
especially in Georgia, a place of which I seemed to have a prospect,
a number of years ago, when confined to the bed of sickness,
and at a time when the heavens appeared as brass, and the earth as iron.
O the pangs,--the unutterable anguish I had to pass through in that day,
when I was brought into a willingness to say, 'Lord,
be graciously pleased to remove this heavy stroke from me,
and if you lead me forth to the end of the land,
and will go before me and favour with a sense of your love and acceptance,
I will follow you,'--and this covenant has been
frequently and humblingly brought into my view.

"`There were eight or ten days between the monthly
meeting of Bush River and the quarterly meeting,
and I was free to make use of this time in going to
Wrightsborough and attending the monthly meeting there,
hoping it might be the means of encouraging some to get out to the quarter,
who otherwise would not.
We accordingly attended the monthly meeting, and the meeting on first-day,
and were much shut up as to public service,
although there was a considerable flocking to meetings, both by Friends and others.
We were both much pained under a sense that something was out of order;
and in a private opportunity, the state of things was opened to Friends,
in a manner which excited their admiration,
seeing we knew so little by outward information.

"`After the two meetings above mentioned,
and one with a little company of hopeful Friends, ten miles nearer to Bush River,
we left them and proceeded to the quarterly meeting; but before I left the place,
I was made sensible that my will must be resigned to turn back again,
and I was not a little concerned about my dear companion,
but on giving him a hint how it felt to me, to my great joy,
I found the same invisible hand had been at work to prepare his mind for the trial.

"`After the quarterly meeting we returned,
and were dipped more deeply into the state of things,
and were happily favoured to feel and see the healing waters stirred among them:
we staid to another monthly meeting,
and left the settlement with the reward of enriching peace in our bosoms.
Our first day's journey on our return was to Augusta, having passed a nearer way before,
but now were under a necessity to go through that place on account of the high waters.
I endeavoured carefully to feel whether it was my place to have a meeting in the town,
but did not see that it was, and so passed quietly away,
but not without the flowing of love and good desires in my heart for the inhabitants.

"`After we had passed over the great bridge of Savannah,
I saw a pretty large number of poor black people, both male and female,
carrying dirt on hand barrows to make a cause-way.
At first sight of them I felt pity flow in my heart toward them,
under a sense of their burdens--and after expressing my sympathy with them,
I found a necessity laid on me to pull off my hat and
preach to them the gospel of Jesus Christ,
their suffering Lord and Saviour.
It was a solemn time; and when I took off my hat, they did so likewise,
and threw aside their tools; and there was loud weeping among them.
In thus unexpectedly labouring among this Ethiopian congregation,
(not having the least thought of such a thing
five minutes before,) there was no lack of words,
or of that seasoning sweetness which makes right words reach the heart,
and under this precious sense,
it would have been as my food and drink to have spent myself in labours of love,
if instead of twenty or thirty, there had been as many hundreds:
great was the sweetness which attended my mind on the road after leaving them.

"`We spent several days at Bush River; attended several meetings, visited some families,
and laboured with a committee of the monthly
meeting for the freedom of some black people;
we also stopped at a place called Edisto,
and had a meeting last first-day,--a few in that
neighbourhood being convinced of Friends' principles.
We arrived here on third-day morning,
and next day attended the little meeting held in this place,
and sat with the few members,
and two Friends who were part of a committee appointed at Bush River,
by request of the meeting for Sufferings, to take some care of matters here.
I wish there had been more zeal and willingness in that committee,
which consists of eight Friends.
I sat most of the meeting in silence, taking a view of our poor, desolate Society here;
how she sits as a mournful, bereaved widow, her walls thrown down,
and her gates burned with fire.
It has appeared to me that Truth, the pure, unchangeable, precious Truth,
will not flourish in this dissipated place,
until the righteous God of Truth rises up to assert his own sovereignty;
and under this sense I have rested peaceful and quiet, feeling very poor and small,
and the prospect of only staying and sitting in Friends' meeting tomorrow,
appears a weighty thing.
We have had the company of a number of the inhabitants at our lodgings,
who have manifested civility and kindness.

"`I hope we shall leave this place after attending two meetings tomorrow.
Bonds and afflictions are our companions both in towns and country places;
and my desire is to be strengthened to endure hardness,
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ ought to do, even to the end of this journey,
and in and through whatsoever my merciful Lord may be pleased to lay upon me,
to the end of my pilgrimage.
I sympathize with you, my dear friend, under your continued exercise,
although I may not at present write much on this subject.
I have admired at seasons how it was with me before I wrote to you from Virginia:
perhaps I may say, that not a day passed and frequently in the day,
without your being brought feelingly into remembrance,
until I relieved my mind by writing to you, since which,
that weight of solicitude has abated.
I still believe, that as you patiently wait, a day of deliverance will come,
and that your labours in a foreign land will not all be like water spilled upon a stone.

"`My love to your dear wife, and father,
Isaac Zane,--may his bow abide in strength to the end.
O how precious to behold such greenness in advanced age!
Such may well be compared to Caleb, who feel as strong in spirit for the Lord's work,
as when he first led them out of Egypt's land.

"`I had like to have forgotten to mention,
that I received a bundle of books since we came to this place,
which I have parcelled out and sent back into the country,
to the care of Friends in remote places, to lend to their inquiring neighbours,
and have written such a request in them.
Some went to Edisto, where there appears to be a considerable stir among the Methodists;
one or two I sent to a Baptist preacher,
who I heard was well pleased with being at one of our meetings,
although I thought it a low, exercising time;
and some others I have engaged a Friend either to send or take himself,
to a man who treated us with much Christian love,
on our way from Tom's Creek to Bush River.
Indeed I have thought that some of our rich merchants,
who have traded long in temporals in our favoured city,
might open an enriching trade in spiritual things, to some of these back parts,
where the name of a Quaker is hardly known, by taking a wagon load of books,
and judiciously distributing them,--and thus be engaged in laying up treasure in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust can corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.
O that the day may be hastened when men will be
more engaged to spread the noble Truth of God,
than to be laying up treasures here on earth, to the corrupting, and I fear,
to the utter destruction of some of their children.`"

"`24th.--Attended meetings in the fore and afternoon, which were small;
and although trying to my spirit, and the labour exercising and close,
yet I was favoured with a solemn calm, which was precious,
and a belief that the Lord has witnesses in this licentious place,
and my heart yearned towards them in their several places of worship.
We had the company of a goodly Methodist at J. K's;
and another good man told me his state was spoken to,
and he hoped it would prove a blessing to him:
he also seemed desirous we might appoint a meeting amongst them,
signifying there would be a willingness amongst his brethren to come;
to which I could say but little.
We had a pretty solid sitting this evening in D. L.'s family, with several other Friends;
and my dear companion says the meetings in this place were solid and profitable;
that he beheld the tears trickling from the eyes of some, to whom he felt much love:
may the Lord be praised for preservation and so favour
us that we may do nothing against the Truth;
for it appears that no mighty works are to be done here.

"`25th.--Arose from my bed peaceful in mind,
and conclude to stay until tomorrow in this place.

"`26th.--Set off after breakfast and a solid tendering opportunity with D. L.'s family,
and parted tenderly from them and also some of the blacks,
and were accompanied by several Friends about sixteen miles.
After we parted from them I had a broken time on the road,
in considering our lonely situation in a strange land, and feeling such great poverty:
however we travelled along and comforted one another.
Stopped and fed our horses near sunset, and afterward rode nine miles to M. M.'s,
and lodged, where we found a quiet house and no company,
which was a comfort to my exercised mind.

"`27th.--We are indeed strangers in a strange land,
yet mercifully favoured with quietness and patience--a favour for which I am thankful.
Set off after the rain was over and rode to Nelson's ferry on the river Santee,
about eighteen miles, where we found the water so high that they would not put us over;
which was a discouraging prospect.
They told us we must ride up the river ten miles, to Manningoe's ferry;
so we sat off in company with a woman who was at a store by the river side,
and said she was going home about five miles,
and would put us in the way through the plantations.
We accordingly accepted of her kindness,
and after we had refreshed ourselves at her house, we concluded to stay all night.
This is a trial of faith and patience,
but I found it good for me to turn my mind to
feel after that Fountain of love and goodness,
which I at times recommend to others.
'Your Maker is your husband, your Redeemer, the holy One of Israel,
the God of the whole earth shall he be called.'
O that I may hold fast my confidence in him!
Spent part of this evening in reading Benjamin
Holmes' 'Serious Call,' to the man and wife,
some of the children, and a young man, a store keeper who lodged here;
I hope to some profit.
I should myself have felt more comfortable if I had abode in true contentment.
O what a very poor creature I sometimes feel like,
when I only deviate as in a tittle from the pure law of life.
O that my slippings may be instructive to me,
and bring me more and more into the divine fear.`"

28th.--After crossing several streams and swamps,
which was attended with considerable hazard, they arrived at Manchester,
where they lodged: in relation to this ride he remarks, "`A desert,
lonely ride this afternoon;
but what are all these outward light afflictions compared to that sense of
poverty and distress which my poor soul has been plunged into this day.
Where are all boasted acquirements,
when the Lord is pleased to veil his sweet presence and
leave the soul to combat with death and sorrow.

"`Third month 1st.--Very poor and distressed this morning,
and hardly ever felt more so than on the road:
a wilderness ride indeed both inwardly and outwardly.
Lord, be graciously pleased not to leave me in my distress, but help your poor servant;
is the cry of my soul.
O that I may be more and more redeemed, and my body made a temple for the Lord my God.
What is man when deprived of the sweet incomes of his love.
I have borne chastisement, and I desire not to offend; that which I see not teach me,
and if I have done any iniquity, purge me and enable me to do so no more.
O the bitterness of death! would to God the children of men,
the unthoughtful children of men, would consider and turn from their transgressions,
that so iniquity may not prove their ruin.
Stopped after riding about twenty miles,--Josiah's mare appears sick and will not eat;
but we got into Camden about two hours before night, where a kind man took us in,
and very hospitably cared for us.
We sat on our horses sometime, in the street,
waiting for him while a negro man went to seek him, hardly knowing what to do,
or where we should lay our heads.
After breakfast next day, being greatly tried between a prospect of staying and going,
I was favoured to hear a language like this, 'it is enough,
move forward;' so we parted from these hospitable people and some others,
after expressing what rested on my mind.
They would take nothing for our stay with them, and sent their good wishes after us,
and a goodly old farmer present gave us a hearty blessing.
Now my spirit was set a little more at liberty, and although we set off in the rain,
the road was pleasant and delightful,
because the darkness and death were in some degree removed,
and my dear companion and I had a solid profitable
conversation respecting our various trials,
and the Lord's mercy and care over us hitherto;
which was a season of setting up our Ebenezer.

"`6th.--To Gum Swamp meeting, which was large,
some of our friends getting up before day to give notice.
I went to it in great poverty,
and after a time apprehended I felt a little opening to stand up,
but found it hard work to get along, and after I had stood sometime,
the carelessness and inattention of the people appeared great,
insomuch that I was defeated in my first prospect,
and I was under a necessity to sit down, believing it safest so to do, as Truth rose not.
But toward the close of the meeting,
I ventured to stand up again and then had close and searching things to deliver,
to a state that is always ready and full of activity, in the will of the creature,
and had to tell them that there were sighs and groans which at seasons cannot be uttered,
which were more acceptable than a multitude of words, songs, prayers,
etc. in man's will and time.
Dined at J. T.'s; after which,
and kneeling down in their family and praying
for the help and protection of the true seed,
scattered in this desert country,
and that the Lord Almighty might turn and overturn all false ways and worships,
and make way for the worship of his dear Son, in spirit and in truth,
we left them and called at W. B.'s, who has given up to accompany us.
We got to our friend M. C.'s, at Pedee, twenty miles, after night.
I have since understood there was occasion for the singular line in which I was led
at Gum Swamp meeting,--one appearing amongst that little company who is a burden,
and the Anabaptists much opposed to Friends in the neighbourhood.

"`8th.--It began to rain hard before day, and continued so until near nine o'clock.
We set off and missed our path to the main road, and had to ride four miles back;
about three miles further we came to a creek which our kind guide entered,
putting the wallet containing our food and horse feed on his shoulders.
It proved so deep as to require him to swim his horse some distance down the stream,
and the water came up nearly to his breast.
However, he got safely through and went up to a house which was near,
and was directed by a woman to a ford higher up.
As we were going to it and had nearly got opposite, he without much thought,
being wet before, rode in.
This, although narrower, was more rapid, and took his horse from under him,
he kept his feet in the stirrups and the saddle
happily having no girth let the horse loose:
he held him by the bridle with one hand, and clung to a bush by the other, until Josiah,
who was foremost, got to his assistance, and both he and the horse were saved.
When he came out of the water both feet were in the
stirrups,--a deliverance for which I am thankful.
We rode up the creek, crossing one little branch after another,
until with difficulty we got over, and rode to the house where our guide left his wallet,
and while he and Josiah cared for the horses,
I went and hunted pine knots to make a fire to dry our friend and Josiah,
who were very wet.
We have been from nine o'clock until one coming four miles.

"`9th.--Arrived at our friend J. T.'s, where we were affectionately received,
and I am afraid of rejoicing overmuch in being thus indulged
once more to be in a settlement of my dear friends.

"`10th.--We went to meeting, +++[+++Deep River]
and the house could not contain the people: yet it was but a low time;
I had a little opening to stand up with,
but although I humbly hope it was from the living spring,
yet I could not get along with satisfaction to myself, and so, soon sat down.`"

They proceeded toward Lynchburg, and on the 14th,
after a slushy muddy ride we got to John Pannel's and lodged.

"`15th.--At the house where we stopped for breakfast,
almost as soon as I got to the fire,
the woman looked toward me and addressed me somewhat after this manner;
'I understand sir, that you are a man of authority, a minister of the gospel,
and a teacher of ignorant ones.
I am one of those poor creatures, and should be glad to hear a word of exhortation.'
I told her I was a poor creature, and had but little for myself,
and after some more conversation on the subject she dropped it,
and went to see about breakfast; and while I was eating, was kindly attentive to me.
After breakfast I walked abroad under thoughtful exercise of mind,
and as I was returning into the house, these expressions fastened on my mind,
'He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you,
but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
And I felt strength and encouragement to invite her,
with her husband and two neighbours who were about the house, to sit down;
and I thought we were favoured with a good time:
I understood afterward by one of our company,
that it was much to this religiously minded woman's satisfaction.

"`16th.--To the monthly meeting of South River,
which was an open time in the first meeting,
and I hope a profitable one in transacting the business, although a searching time;
we got to C. Johnson's near sunset.

"`17th.--To the first-day meeting, which was large, the house not holding the people;
and I have not experienced such an open time to preach the gospel for months past,
and was favoured through the prevalence of divine goodness,
to water and be watered myself Friends after meeting were affectionately kind to me.
Went home with our friend John Lynch near the meeting house,
and had a solid opportunity in the family, several others being present.

"`18th.--Sat down and wrote a letter to the little
company of persons who profess with us at Bannister;
principally directed to Elizabeth Hendricks,
who was the first that stood forth in the cause of truth in that neighbourhood.`"

Extracts from the letter.

Lynchburg, Third month 18th, 1793.

Beloved friend, Elizabeth Hendricks:

As it is not likely I shall have an opportunity to see you,
I thought I should be most easy to sit down and inform you,
that since I first heard of your religious concern to be found
building up and repairing the waste places in Zion,
it has had a sweet savour in my mind; and the desire of my heart is,
that the Lord may strengthen you to hold on with faithfulness and firmness in the work.
Mighty is he who calls forth his devoted children and servants; may you,
dear young woman, with your dear sister, with whom I gained some acquaintance,
your other relations, and all concerned ones in the neighbourhood,
where your lot is cast; keep in the divine fear,
for in the fear of the Lord there is strong confidence,
and his children have a place of refuge to flee unto in every time of need.

Therefore, know him to be your sanctuary; wait upon him in humble depending patience,
in all your meetings,
and your minds will be animated and lifted up above the world and the fading,
perishing things of it.
Be often found, through the day,
when your hands are employed about the lawful business of fife,
lifting up your hearts to God for protection and support.
For be assured that there is no state in which
preservation from evil and unprofitable thoughts,
is more likely to be experienced,
than in a habitual and constant communion with the God of our lives.
When we meet with temptations of various kinds, by often looking to him,
a secret yet living hope revives in the midst of tribulation,
that the temptation will have an end, and that the Lord will make a way for us to escape,
as we hold fast our confidence in him; as the Scriptures declare,
blessed is the man that endures temptation; that is,
who dare not fly from the Lord in this proving season;
which will be but as for a moment to the upright in heart.
After these have nobly stood their ground, they receive the crown of life and peace,
which the Lord has promised to all them that love him;
and thus our many and various afflictions and trials, which are necessary to humble us,
if rightly abode under, bring us nearer and nearer to the righteous God of our lives.
I have heard of singular instances,
in which divine goodness has supported even an individual,
or individuals although few in number,
who have been concerned to bear a public testimony,
by sitting down in a religious meeting in order to wait upon and honour him;
and in time more have been drawn by such an example to come and do likewise,
until at length there has been a meeting of spiritual worshippers gathered,
who have been made as lights in a neighbourhood.
The Lord loves cheerful givers; he loves the gates of Zion,
more than all the dwelling places in Jerusalem:
he loves those who are found watching and keeping the door of their hearts and lips,
and he will appear unto such and dispense the bread of life to them.
Therefore, as you have begun a good work in the face of the neighbourhood,
may you be found seeking strength of the Lord, to enable you to hold on your way:
be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly and sisterly love,
in honour preferring one another:
strive to excel one another in innocency and virtuous living,
and you will be favoured to see who is to be held in
the greatest honour and esteem for the work's sake,
even such as live the most exemplary lives.
Let no vain glorying or strife be among you;
but remember that he or she who is the least in their own opinion, walking in humility,
circumspection and godly fear, is the greatest.
May you live in love, and then no doubt the God of love and peace will be with you,
and increase you in the increases of his love, favour and acceptance.
He will then accept of your offerings,
although they may sometimes be no more than a secret sigh and inward groan,
which cannot be uttered so as to be heard by others.
The acceptable sacrifice to the Lord is that of a broken heart,
and a contrite and tender spirit in religious meetings,
even when we can breathe forth no more than something after this manner,
in inward desire,--Lord I am poor and sorrowful,
let your salvation appear to lift up my soul,
and engage it to hold on in the way you have cast up for me;
or Lord help me or I shall faint and fall; for he who is a pure and spiritual being,
hears the groans of the wrestling seed within us.
God is a spirit, and they that worship him acceptably,
must worship him in spirit and in truth.
Therefore keep true in heart: be sincere,--remember that the Lord sees us at all times:
sincerity is the life of all our graces, and puts life into all our duties.
If we have not sincerity and truth of heart,
then all our performances will be no more than a dead thing,
offensive in the nostrils of God,
who will not then smell our offerings as a sweet savour.

My dear companion and fellow labourer in the work of the gospel, Josiah Bunting,
unites in tender desires for your preservation and growth.
We thought to have stopped in your neighbourhood,
but finding that the people on the road knew not how to direct us rightly,
and time being but short for us to go to South River monthly meeting, we omitted it;
perhaps I may venture to say, that divine Providence has so ordered it for the best,
that your expectation of help from instruments may be
disappointed--your attention weaned from man,
and that your hearts and hands may be turned to look unto and lean upon the Lord,
for in him there is everlasting strength.`"

"`19th.--Set off about nine o'clock accompanied by W. H.,
after a solid religious opportunity with these young friends, and rode forty-five miles.
We stopped about the middle of the afternoon at Hood's,
the place where we called the family together when S. P. was with us, six months ago,
and gave them Joseph Phipps' works, and hope it will be to profit.

"`20th.--This day rode fifty miles; stopped by the way at J. F.'s,
who appears to be a goodly seeking man:
may the Lord enlighten his mind to see the beauty and excellency of Truth.
These two long days' rides have been peaceful to me,
and I do not know that I have left anything undone that causes pain.
The Lord be praised for his protection and help so far:
we arrived at our kind friend Samuel Couch's after seven in the evening.
It is ten months this day since I left my habitation.

"`24th.--Set off for Genito meeting about an hour before the time,
and spent it with dear Mary Pleasants.
The meeting was the largest held in this place,
the house not containing the people by many; and continued in silence nearly,
or quite two hours, and I thought would have concluded so;
but a degree of strength was at length given,
and I trust I laboured honestly once more amongst them,
and hope the meeting ended profitably, although it held three hours and a half.

In a letter written from Beaver Dam, Virginia, to John Pemberton, he says:

I received your letter at our friend R. Pleasants',
which at that time was comfortable to me,
and the tenor of it has been peculiarly so since, in a close trial which overtook me,
wherein I had encouragingly to remember this expression contained therein,
'the work of righteousness is peace.'
I seem as if I cannot forbear informing you,
that when I have been riding in lonely and wilderness ways,
day after day and oftentimes in the day, my thoughts have been turned toward you,
insomuch that I have had to pause and inquire with myself,
what is the cause that the cogitations of my heart are
so much fixed on an individual in that great city,
where so many dwell whom I nearly love?
Is my beloved friend labouring under close exercise of mind at this season, and am I,
a younger brother, made to partake in spirit with him though far separated?
At such seasons, as now, you have been made near to me,
I believe by Him who metes out the portions of all of us by just weight and measure,
and who has declared that 'the needy shall not always be forgotten,
nor the expectation of the poor perish forever.'
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice,
surely he will take notice of and record the honest labours of those who,
at his command spend many of their days in endeavours
to gather souls into his everlasting kingdom,
even though little fruit may be visible to them.
After this manner has my spirit been led to look over
your labours and travels in lands very far remote,
and receiving this for an answer, it has been preciously comfortable to me;
there shall be a glorious recompense in the resurrection of the just.

I have thought at such seasons that I could say much more to you, my heart being full,
but let this suffice.
It is my firm belief, that the Lord was with you in your visit among the Orkney Islands,
and the seed which you have sown in that land,
at the command of the great Lord of the whole family of mankind,
shall not be gathered up by the wicked one,
but in the Lord's time spring up to the praise of his adorable name.
With regard to your present prospect, my desire is that you may still pray for patience,
and be kept in that patience which enables to run the race,
and at last obtains the crown.
The Lord is on his way, I believe, to set you at liberty, and no matter how,
so that it is seen to be his doing, which will be marvellous in your eyes.
I wish you to live still in that which dare not think the time long,
and which keeps us in true devotion of heart, so as to say, 'here am I, send me.'

I am persuaded that the more the wife of your bosom, your affectionate companion,
comes to be resigned to the will of an all-wise and overruling Providence,
the more of the incomes of true and lasting peace she will experience.
Submitting to that divine power which qualifies for every good word and work,
in her family and in the church,
she will be prepared in divine authority to say unto others,
'arise you careless women that are at ease, awake out of sleep you lukewarm,
unconcerned daughters; let us be in earnest to get our day's work done in the day time,
for the shades of evening advance quickly.'
And O that she may ask counsel of God, and wait for it,
with regard to your heavy exercise,
that by an entire resignation of heart in all things to the Lord's will,
putting away every weight and burden which may arise from the reasoning part,
true peace may flow into her heart, and the Lord's will be done in you both,
by you and upon you,
to the praise of his excellent name in the end--
so wishes your exercised friend and brother,
who has written as things arise, in the simplicity of a child;
and who is a child and needs the care and the prayers of all those his elders,
who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity.

We get but slowly along, but for every little act of faith and labour of love,
there has been a rich reward bestowed by Him who has a right to our obedience.
Dear Josiah is an encouraging, feeling companion,
preserved in much patience under the many singular turns we meet with,
which endears him to me.

I believe the Lord gave me some place in +++_______+++'s heart when at his house,
and my prayers are, that the Lord may 'smite both his winter and summer house,
throw down his palaces of ivory,
and bring him to mourn in the dust because of Him whom he has pierced.'
I mourn over him and for him while I am writing,
because I see what an instrument of good he might have been, and may yet be, I hope,
if with unreserved obedience he yields up his will unto
the will of the great Author of his being,
who can as suddenly meet with him as he did with Nebuchadnezzar of old,
when all things may seem to go on pleasantly as to the outward.

"`25th.--This morning a sober Anabaptist woman came to see us,
and after a solid baptising opportunity with the family,
and such other Friends as were here, we set off accompanied by several,
and stopped to see a Friend who is confined,
where we had another solid opportunity with him, wife and children;
after which we went to our friend Micajah Crew's at Cedar Creek.
The same conflict attended me yesterday, as did in a meeting before at Genito,
and I was painfully exercised in treating with an infidel unbelieving state;
and have been told since, that a person was there again,
who was at meeting when we were here before; and it was remarked by his neighbours,
that what was then said had come to pass, namely: that the time might soon come,
when some would be laid on a sick bed, which he was, and has recovered,
and then they would have to remember the doctrine sounded in their ears;
which it seems he did, for he was brought almost to death's door.`"

In a letter to Rebecca Jones, written from Cedar Creek, Virginia, he says:

"`Your sisterly token of remembrance, which came safely to hand at Curies,
tended to my encouragement.
O how good and pleasant a thing it is,
when thus separated from our dear brethren and sisters,
to find that we have a place in their minds.
It must undoubtedly have been so with the Apostle,
or he would not have left these feeling expressions on record, 'Brethren pray for us.'
My mind is at seasons sweetly turned toward my beloved friends of our meeting,
with secret breathings that you may be kept in your tents,
and enabled to worship as in the tent door.
These precious seasons of remembrance I am frequently favoured with,
when riding along the road, and looking back on my dear friends,
and may I not say that one of the greatest favours I enjoy,
is that of sensibly feeling the unity and help of the spirits of my friends.
May I ever be so preserved in lowliness, as not to forfeit this precious oneness.
My dear sister, the harvest is great, great in these parts, and the labourers very few.
I have thought of you and dear Hannah Cathrall several times lately;
whether there are not sheaves that you and other gifted
sisters might come and gather up here in Virginia.
Bear with me,
for sometimes I think I feel a little of the disposition and spirit of Moses,
and would to God there were more made to prophesy,--sent abroad,
even unto the four corners of the earth,
to declare the way of life and salvation through Jesus Christ our Lord.
May you remember, that the night is approaching,
when none can work,--how necessary is it then to labour at all times and in all places,
both at home and abroad, when favoured with a sight and sense of our duty,
that so in the evening of the day, this language may happily be ours,
'I have finished the work which you gave me to do.'`"

"`27th.--To the week-day meeting at Cedar Creek,
in which I was exercised in very great weakness and poverty;
but I felt easy and quiet after it.

"`28th.--Spent this day at T. H.'s, the fore part in close thoughtful exercise,
seeing no way open to move: this continued until after we had dined,
when we went into the sick room; and had not sat long,
before a sweetness accompanied by a solid exercise spread over me,
and I desired that the rest of the family might be called in.
In this opportunity I was concerned to go on my knees,
and beg the continuance of the blessing of preservation to us poor travellers,
and that the Lord might be graciously pleased to open a way,
where none at times appeared;
to bless and favour the heads of this family and all present;
and be near to our aged parents we had left behind, and comfort and support their minds,
as also my dear wife's,
and take our dear children more and more under his protection and care:
after which I had an open time in testimony,
which I trust will prove like bread cast on the waters, to be found after many days.
We then visited three negro families on this plantation, to our satisfaction:
indeed it is a comfort to see some of those people live so reputably and well;
they have rented land of T. H. Spent the evening peacefully and pleasantly.

"`29th.--Peaceful and easy in mind this morning:
O what a favour to be indulged now and then to
feel comfortable and quiet in our allotment!

"`30th.--Spent this day at C. T. M.'s, partly in writing.
After dinner the black children came in with their books to read their lessons,
which they performed cleverly,
and I was comforted in beholding such care and attention toward them.
C.'s wife came in amongst the men, at the yearly meeting,
to plead the cause of this people, and she might with propriety do so,
seeing she is in her own example what she then recommended to her brethren.
O that there were more such in this land.

"`31st.--To Caroline meeting, where was a gay, mixed assembly; and according to the day,
so was the strength afforded to preach the everlasting gospel; it was an open good time;
several members of Congress were present,
one of whom came to me after I had got into the wagon and said,
« Permit me to give you my hand, although a stranger, and my best wishes go with you.'

"`Fourth month 2nd and 3rd.--Stopped at A. J.'s at Stephensburg,
who accompanied us almost twelve miles on our way to Culpepper.
Ate our dinners on the grass by the bank of the Rappahannock river,
after we had forded it.
Got to J. G.'s; this has been an evening of exercise, feeling for my way,
what to move in next.

"`4th.--A heavy time this morning:
I cannot see anything that looks easier than to visit the few families of Friends here,
and so am made willing to give up to the prospect,--Lord help me, a poor servant.
Sat down with this family, and it was a watering, encouraging time,
to the father in particular.
We sent for his son and wife, she was with us,
but he plead that he could not leave his men, who were at work.
I hope it was a good time.

Several other families were visited this day,
in which he was favoured with "`baptizing seasons,`"--he remarks,
"`It has been a day of sweetness,--the Lord fulfills his promises to his servants;
He that labours receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal:
blessed be the name of the Lord.`"

5th and 6th.--He was occupied in visiting the families about Stephensburg,
in nearly all of which he describes his services as being well received,
and accompanied with a baptising and reaching effect.

"`7th.--A comfortable, refreshing night.
'I sleep, but my heart wakes; and it is the voice of my beloved that knocks.'
I feel renewed in my bodily powers this morning, for which favour I am humbly thankful.
Had a large, open, favoured meeting to day at Southland,
which afforded encouragement to my mind.
After I had been pretty largely drawn forth in gospel love to the people,
and had sat down,
I was concerned to stand up again and address the inhabitants
of the little town of Stephensburg in particular;
cautioning and encouraging the merchants and innkeepers
to sanctify the Lord in their occupations,
and the youth to beware of reading pernicious books, such as plays, novels, and romances;
and I trust the meeting ended solidly and well.
After it was over many persons not of our Society came and spoke to me,
and appeared loving.
May the Lord have the praise of his own work,
whose name and truth have been exalted this day,
through the efficacy of his divine power.
It appeared to me, that there will in time be a gathering of such in this neighbourhood,
who will be instrumental in the divine hand to spread the testimony of Truth.
O says my soul, may it be so here, and throughout the earth, that praises, high praises,
may ascend from sanctified and prepared vessels, to the everlasting,
holy and merciful God, who is our only upholder and preserver.
Amen.`"

In a letter to Rebecca Jones, dated Curies, fourth month 7th, 1793, he writes as follows:

Although it is uncertain when or where this may meet you,
I thought as I felt the springing up of a measure of that love
which unites the children of the heavenly Father's family,
both present and absent, I would try to write to you.
Your last letter was sweet and encouraging to my wading mind,
which is frequently very closely exercised,
with earnest desires that I may approve myself, not only unto God and his people,
but to others also, a servant who is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,
or of those bonds which are its constant attendants.
Unworthy as I feel myself, my lot seems to be cast, more than that of many others,
among those whose walks are, as it were, in the streets and lanes of the city,
and in the highways and hedges; and my concern is to hold on in faithfulness,
clear my way as I go, and endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ,
that so my return may be with the reward of unshaken peace.
I have been absent from home almost twelve months,
and am now turned back again nearly or quite one hundred and fifty miles,
and the chief service which presents,
seems to be amongst people of other religious persuasions.
We have had several meetings in towns and neighbourhoods,
where large numbers have gathered,
and so far divine mercy and kindness have been near to support and bear me up.
Blessed be the Lord, his goodness and truth have been witnessed, who, even to this day,
gives mouth and wisdom,
tongue and utterance to those that are living in a humble and abasing sense of the
force and truth of those expressions which dropped from his sacred lips,
'Without me, you can do nothing.'

It was pleasing to me to hear of the devotedness of my dear fellow
servants who are going to and fro in the service of the gospel;
and that so many have given up to go with the Commissioners into the Indian country.^
footnote:[For some account of the engagements of the Friends
who went to the Treaty with the Indians at Sandusky,
to which Thomas Scattergood here alludes, see the Journal of William Savery, vol.
1st of Friends' Library, page 331, etc.]
I feel with and for them, and for dear George and Sarah Dillwyn, and Elizabeth Drinker.^
footnote:[George and Sarah Dillwyn and Elizabeth Drinker,
were under religious concern to visit the churches in Great Britain.]
I was also glad to find that you, my sister, who have been going on your way in secret,
silent travail, are likely to go forth in gospel mission,
I trust to water and refresh those abroad,
who may be under the like dispensation in lonely spots and places.
Be faithful, dear sister, in your allotment, that so your reward may be sure.
O how good is the Lord to those who live in devotedness of heart,
fulfilling that ancient declaration; 'Though you have lien amongst the pots,
yet shall you be as the wings of a dove covered with silver,
and her feathers with yellow gold.'
May the Lord give the word, and in his time,
increase the company of them that shall publish it.

"`We are waiting the coming on of the yearly meeting,
not without some prospect of further labour out of the pale of our Society,
and can say but little more than that I desire
to live in that spirit which enables us to say,
'Your will be done,' even under the most trying dispensations.
Tell my dear friend and brother David Sands, that although when I received his letter,
I was so dull a scholar that I could not fully understand his language, yet since,
I have been led about and instructed more fully,
and believe he was favoured with a lively sense of my tried condition.
May the Lord preserve him, with my own soul, under his divine protection and favour,
through all the various trials which may yet be permitted to come upon us,
and at last crown our end with everlasting peace.`"

"`9th.--This morning I took an opportunity while we were quietly riding along the road,
to inform my companion that a prospect of being at the yearly meeting in Virginia,
had been resting as a weight and exercise on my mind;
and although at seasons the prospect of getting home to our quarterly meeting next month,
looked pleasing, yet my will was required to be given up;
to which he did not make any objection.
So I left it with him; and when after a time, I rode up alongside of him again,
he spoke encouragingly to me, and wished me not to be cast down under my burdens,
but patiently submit to the yoke; observing,
that when I first mentioned my prospect to him, he was prepared for it;
for he had been thinking of the preservations we had been favoured with,
and the trials we had been helped through.

"`10th.--Not many at the meeting but Friends;
and it was a season wherein I had to feel sympathy with, and speak encouragingly to,
a small remnant, exhorting them not to cast away their confidence:
the careless also were called unto; and upon the whole it was a good meeting.
Put up at Fredericksburg at a tavern.

"`11th.--Got to our friend C. M.'s.

"`12th.--I feel solitary in again turning my back upon home; nevertheless, O my soul,
hope in, and rely upon, the arm of Divine strength,
hitherto mercifully held forth for your help.

"`13th.--C. M. and wife took us to Cedar Creek monthly meeting,
in which I was led to speak, I hope feelingly, and in degree effectually,
to a tried state present.

"`14th, first-day.--Went to meeting: wait O my soul,
to be found doing the will of your God, in this your lonely state.
O for preservation to hold out to the end of this journey! more depth, more patience,
more stability and solidity are lacking to carry through and over all.
The meeting was large and mixed, and was a favoured season;
the Lord be praised for strength and renewed
ability to ease my exercised mind amongst them.
An ancient man, T. M. came to me after meeting, and said, 'you did not number my age,
for I am four score and five;
but you have traced my state from a boy until this day,' etc.
A young man came afterward and affectionately took me by the hand,
and expressed his desire that the Lord might be my preserver and protector through time,
and at last give me an admittance into his everlasting kingdom.

"`16th.--I am blind and poor this morning; not knowing which way to take, or what to do.
O that I may be preserved in that patience which gains the victory,
and be so kept as to do nothing against the Truth.

"`17th.--To the week-day meeting; and after it, home with Thomas Terrill.
A little before night a number of Friends came, and also an aged man, an Anabaptist;
we were pleased with their kind notice and attention,
and their openness and freedom in conversation; and we read our certificates to them,
mine being directed not only to Friends, but also to solid inquirers after the Truth.
One of the company said he was at both the meetings at Richmond,
and that a gentleman told him,
when noticing what I said concerning the abominations acted in that place,
that he feared Sodom was not more guilty.`"

18th and 19th.--Spent in visiting families,
and on the 20th he went to Fredericksburg and appointed a meeting.

"`21st.--To a large mixed meeting held in a room over the market place.
It was quiet and ended well, and my heart is thankful for preservation and favour.

"`22nd.--My mind feels comfortable in looking
back over yesterday's work,--good is the Lord,
may my soul say, and worthy to be trusted in and obeyed.
Rode to our friend Thomas Terrill's, twenty-eight miles, with a sweet and easy mind.
'The disciples were not to rejoice that devils were made subject to them,
but that their names were written in the Lamb's book of life.'
O that I may more and more learn this great lesson;
to rejoice in tribulation as well as in favoured seasons.

"`23rd.--Visited a family in which we were favoured with a good time.

"`24th.--To meeting,--a crowded and very laborious one;
but trust the labour will not be lost.
Truth appeared comfortably over us at the close,
and I had to stand up and recommend more care and
attention to the education of the black children,
stirring up the youth in families to engage in the good work of instructing them;
many being present of different societies.

"`28th.--Went to Cedar Creek meeting; it was a comfortable peaceful ride there,
and most of the meeting a season of sweet silence;
but in the close I had a little to communicate to the weak and feeble of the flock,
and in the end to stir up to prize the day of lengthened out mercy,
and while the day lasted to do justly and love mercy,
lest it might be shortened and their judge come as a thief at a time unexpected.
Stopped at Thomas Stanley's, accompanied by Micajah Crew and wife,
and had a religious opportunity,
in which the parents were encouraged to attend to their gifts,
and be patient under the various operations of the divine hand;
also to be careful in the education of their children, who appear lovely.
Went home with Micajah Crew under exercise,
it being about nine months since we were first here,
and now have to traverse the same path again, and at this season in a state of blindness.
Wait, O my soul, in humble submission,
upon your never failing Helper for the further unfolding of his will;
although you sit at present in a state of darkness or lack of light.
I find a precious, kind brother and fellow helper in Micajah Crew.

"`30th.--A stormy night, and continues so this morning, and I see no opening to move.
These dispensations are trials of faith and patience,
but when I remember that all things shall work together for
good to those who continue in the obedience of faith,
my mind is calmed in the midst thereof.
Spent this day also at Micajah Crew's, the after part in pretty close exercise.

"`Fifth month 1st.--Though feeling poor and weak,
I have ventured to pack up my clothes and feel willing to go on, if the way opens.
Lord, so order and direct my steppings along,
as that I may not linger through cowardice and fear.
You are all sufficient; I trust in you, O gracious Helper!
Unless your divine presence goes with me,
take me not hence--may I not be permitted to go into any further religious labour.
I opened the Bible, and cast my eye on the fifty-fourth Psalm, and read it to my comfort.

"`After breakfast set off, accompanied by Micajah Crew,
in order to go to our friend Robert Pleasants'; had a sorrowful ride to Curies,
and continued to feel so after our arrival.
Spent the evening heavily,
although we met with a very kind reception from this dear aged friend.

"`2nd.--A morning of heavy conflict; went to Curies meeting,
where were only six white males, three females, and two black women: a time of exercise,
but was favoured to pour out my supplications among the few who met,
and in the end was a little comforted in an assured belief,
that Truth remains to be Truth,
although many of the descendants of those who were valiants for its promotion,
have forsaken it.
I prayed for them, and that the Lord would preserve us.
O for patience to hold out faithfully to the end of this journey,
and receive the sheaves of peace.

"`3rd.--I have spent this day in an exercised condition: who is so blind as your servant,
or so deaf as your messenger.
O! what a fearful thing it is to incur that reproof from the Lord; 'You have run,
and I have not sent you, therefore you shall not profit the people at all.'
May I be kept subjectly given up to do his will; yes,
humbly and patiently to wait for the pointing of my heavenly Master's finger,
and that more stability and gravity may be the girdle of my loins.

"`4th.--A little opening presented in much weakness and fear to go towards Petersburg:
if your presence, O Lord, go not with me, take me not hence, is the language of my soul.
All I desire is clearness of sight, and let your will be done.
Set off and felt peaceful on the road; got there between two and three o'clock,
and obtained a large room in a tavern for holding a meeting;
hearing that the court house was to be occupied by an Episcopalian.

"`5th.--What a poor servant, if worthy to take the name.
O for more purity of heart,
that so I may be indulged with greater clearness to see the Lord's will and do it.
It was discouraging to me when I heard of a meeting advertised
to be held in the new court house for the first time,
and that there was to be a Methodist meeting also, to begin at eleven o'clock.
However, our friends took considerable pains to spread the notice of ours,
and it proved large, quiet and satisfactory;
much to the ease and relief of my exercised mind, although I was greatly spent after it.
In the afternoon we had a meeting with Friends
and such as made any pretensions to own us,
which was a comfortable time to me: after I had finished my testimony,
my spirit was poured out in humble supplication,
in which my own and my companion's family were brought into remembrance.
I was so spent with the labours of this day, that I could not sleep as usual,
but all was well, peace being the best portion;
for which I am thankful to the Father and Fountain of all our sure mercies.

"`6th.--After an opportunity with this family where we staid, and some of the neighbours,
left Petersburg with sweet peace,
and rode home with our beloved friend and brother R. Pleasants.

"`8th.--Last night was one of mental conflict,
and such has been the state of my mind this day; however,
this evening I feel rather easier.
I have been delighted frequently, since we have been here, with the singing of birds,
particularly between daylight and sunrise.

"`9th.--To Curies meeting, which was silent and a deeply exercising,
tribulated time to me, as well as before as after the meeting was over.
O what a singular path I tread! yet let not one murmuring thought arise,
but wait in patience to see the end of every trying dispensation.
My body is weak and reduced by exercise of mind.
May I be favoured to hold on in the way that is cast up;
for all these sufferings are not on my own account,--there is a cause.
Zion lies waste, her walls are thrown down, and her gales are consumed as by fire,
her sons gone into grievous captivity, for which I mourn day by day.

"`12th.--Very poor indeed: rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,
continuing instant in prayer, was the advice of the apostle Paul,
and O that it may yet be, in measure, my experience; hope for a different dispensation,
O my soul.
Went to Curies meeting once more, where we found a larger gathering than on week-days,
but a cloudy, dark time: yet I ventured to relieve my very pained mind freely,
and afterwards felt easier, and spent the remainder of the day so.

"`15th.--Spent this day quietly at R. P.'s, reading in Thomas Story's life;
opened on that passage where he speaks of the kind treatment
of John Bates of Skimino,--which brought to my remembrance the
comfortable feeling I was favoured with,
when at that meeting,
and which I had to mention to some of the descendants of this
worthy man when they gathered about me after meeting.
Some of the children of Benjamin Bates now living there, appeared hopeful;
they were pretty much reached and broken.
I copied it, in order to present it to some of them to peruse.

"`16th and 17th.--Attended the meeting of ministers and elders at White Oak Swamp,
and the quarterly meeting at Wainoak,--The 18th, to the meeting for Sufferings.

"`19th.--To a very large and mixed meeting, the house mostly filled up with women.
Joseph Cloud and J. Mendenhall, appeared in the fore part of the meeting;
but there was such a multitude out of doors, and many so uneasy and rude,
that it was a cause of grief.
My mind was exercised to leave my seat and go to one of the doors,
and endeavour to cast off my burden: my companion followed,
and I requested a few Friends to go out of doors and gather the people near the door,
and keep them quiet,--and it was indeed a laborious time to speak to such a crowd,
so as to be heard within and without the doors.
There are no people, whose states and conditions are so distressing and burdensome,
as those who have turned away in heart from the simplicity of Truth,
and become deistical and unbelieving.
O how my life has been oppressed with it this day, and often before in this land.

"`20th.--More people assembled this day than could get into the house,
and they appeared to be mostly such as were orderly;
and I hope a number of goodly seeking ones.
The two Hopewell Friends appeared in the early part of the meeting,
after which I had a pretty thorough opportunity, open and relieving to my spirit;
and indeed I felt like another man after it: the Lord be praised for his goodness.

"`21st.--An open satisfactory meeting today; things being well conducted,
and I feel peaceful and easy.

"`22nd.--To the meeting of ministers and elders at nine o'clock, which was a comfortable,
instructive season.
At the eleventh hour the yearly meeting sat, to which came Joseph Cloud;
and after a time of silence,
he stood up and requested the partition might be opened for the women to hear;
and in a tender manner began with nearly these words:
'You see my friends to what a state of bodily weakness I am reduced.
I have come this morning to express among you the great desire I feel,
that all present may be concerned to attend to their gifts;
for all our riches and the comforts of this life,
will do us but little good when brought to such a state as I am in.
I feel resigned and peaceful amongst you, and am glad I am here,' etc.
After which I embraced the present season to relieve my mind towards the visited youth.

"`23rd.--To the adjournment at ten o'clock, and meeting held until near six,
and got through the business, which was well conducted and to good satisfaction,
both in this sitting and others.
In the close thereof my mind was drawn forth in love again towards Friends,
and the youth in particular, and it appeared to be a solemn good parting;
numbers taking me very affectionately by the hand and parted in nearness.`"

In a letter written from Wainoak, dated fifth month 24th, 1793,
addressed to his beloved friend John Pemberton, he says;

The yearly meeting closed yesterday afternoon, and being now released from that service,
my mind is exercised with further openings of duty.
I have just been conferring with a number of my dear friends,
respecting another meeting at Richmond on first-day next,
and several are engaged to go and prepare the way.
I have often had thoughts of attending the quarterly meeting of Fairfax,
held a little more than two weeks from this time;
and when the prospect has been weightily before me,
I have thought it would contribute to the relief of my exercised mind,
to have it in my power to distribute some valuable small
tracts to some of the inhabitants in the Alleghany mountains,
in the way between Redstone and Fairfax.
I see the necessity to stir up Friends, when travelling backwards and forwards,
to leave such books at public houses and at other places on the way,
and have no doubt but some may be engaged in this good work,
who may attend the next quarterly meeting.
As there are a number of Friends of the yearly
meeting's committee likely to attend there,
if you could send by some of them I should be glad; but more so, my dear friend,
to see yourself thus employed in your usual enriching
and useful mode of disseminating useful knowledge.
I have had much satisfaction in spreading those sent to Charleston,
several of which I brought into Virginia and gave them
to goodly people where Friends mostly put up,
and they were cheerfully and kindly received by them.
One of Joseph Phipps' books I sent to a young woman at Banister,
who has been instrumental to raise up the ruins in that place, by meeting for a season,
in the old forsaken meeting-house, by herself,
and by her exemplary conduct has drawn others to join her.
She has been with us at yearly meeting,
and I think bids fair to become a princess among the Lord's people.

I have had much peace and comfort in my labours in this yearly meeting, which has been,
I am informed, unusually large.
On first-day morning there appeared to be as many people out of doors,
as would have filled another house as large as the one we were in;
and poor and cast down as I often feel, I have occasion to acknowledge that the Lord,
my gracious helper, has not forsaken me in the most trying moments:
my desire is that I may fully and faithfully follow Him to the end of this journey;
and also if further dispensations should be permitted to exercise my faith and patience.

I do not know a more useful book of the size than Benjamin Holme's Serious Call,
and believe a couple of dozens might be profitably spread as I have mentioned before.
Perhaps some of the Friends will come in carriages,
as I fear it will be too late to send them by water to Alexandria.
I would have written sooner,
but my poverty and blindness is such that sometimes I
cannot get at things until the last pinch.

It seems to come before me just to say,
that Friends who have had occasion to go on business
into some of the towns where we have had meetings,
have told me that the people appear much satisfied with them;
which has been encouraging to me.
Truly it has been a trying dispensation for me, a poor weak one,
thus to go out from among Friends, but I cannot plead excuse in any way.
I am blessed with a solid, feeling elder for a companion, and my Lord and Master,
from season to season, lifts up my head out of a state of great weakness;
into which I see it is necessary for me first to be baptized:
may His holy name be reverenced and praised for the protection and help vouchsafed,
without which, I know I should faint and fall.

"`24th.--After engaging some Friends to be in Richmond early next morning,
to see about a meeting there on first-day, went to the widow Ladd's,
where I hope we had a seasonable opportunity: we returned back to J. Ladd's,
in company with Joseph Cloud, David Vestal, and a number of other Friends;
after which had the family together,
and the opportunity proved a solemn affecting season.
Dear Joseph is so weak that he has given out going to Richmond with us,
although his prospect on leaving home was to that place and other towns;--however,
he sat with us and was favoured to deliver an affecting testimony.

While I sat by him in silence, as well as at other seasons,
my mind was humbled in beholding his great weakness,
now so far from his dear wife and family,
and also in a sense of the Lord's goodness to me,
in affording so much bodily strength as to move along from place to place,
as Truth has opened the way.
On the close of his communication I ventured to kneel down and pray for him,
the family and Friends present, for myself and companion in labour;
and that the Lord my God might be pleased to continue the wife of my
bosom under his protection and favour--and to preserve us in patience,
if our faith and love are to be tried by a yet longer separation.
After this I had to labour with some of the children in particular,
encouraging those who are in the right way,
and cautioning and warning others of impending danger.
After which look a solemn farewell.

"`25th.--Rode to Richmond,
after a satisfactory opportunity with some Friends and the family.

"`26th.--Attended the meeting at Richmond, which was large, numbers being out of doors,
and much rudeness appeared in some.
It was upon the whole, a quiet meeting,
although there were some so hardy as to laugh in my face while I was speaking,
who met a suitable reproof before all, to their shame.
At the close I mentioned a prospect I had of a meeting with the black people,
at the same place, at five o'clock in the afternoon,
and told them it was a delicate thing, but I stood open, if anyone had any objection,
and wished some of their sober masters to come and be with us.
We found afterwards that it was somewhat alarming, but no opposition appeared,
and we had a number of them together, with many whites also,
in which I had a quiet opportunity to relieve my mind.

"`27th.--Awoke early this morning,
under the weight of a prospect which had opened on my mind,
to see the little company of Friends here together, and such as go no other way.
I had made an attempt yesterday in the meeting at large, to address them,
but found it would not do;
so I now requested Samuel Parsons to collect them together by half-past nine o'clock,
which he did, and we were favoured with a solid, instructive, and I hope,
baptising opportunity, at least to some.
James Mendenhall and his companion, Jonathan Wright, David Vestal,
Thomas Harris and wife staying,
we were about thirty in number at J. S. Pleasants'. Josiah, S. Parsons and I,
went to bid the mayor, Robert Mitchell, farewell, who had been kind,
and attended both meetings; he appeared well pleased with that for the negroes,
though he said he was solicited by some of the inhabitants to put a stop to it;
and that he himself feared it would be of bad consequence,
but I believe none had any occasion to be uneasy:
the mayor confessed that the doctrine was suitable to them, and to the whites also.

"`O the wickedness and the abominations of this little city!
Is it any wonder at all, that I have gone through the sufferings which I have;
but thanks be given to Him who is ever worthy, on leaving the mayor,
and telling him how the mountebanks' sign which hung out in the street,
and their other wicked doings, struck at my life, and leaving it with him,
I felt on walking away, relieved and peaceful.
Left the place between one and two o'clock, and rode in company with several Friends,
pleasant and easy in mind.

"`30th.--To Genito meeting,
in which my mind was exercised on account of a visited seed hereaway,
and I was drawn forth in love to them: it appeared to be a watering season.

"`Sixth month 1st.--We had thought of going on to Southland to day, but I felt unwell,
and withal my mind was turned towards the first-day meeting here,
and we concluded to stay; and after breakfast I went to bed.
In and through all,
may I yet be favoured not to give way to the drawings of the affectionate part homeward,
but say with resignation of mind, 'Here am I Lord, you have hitherto been my support,
protection, and help, and can keep that which you have enabled me to commit to your care.

"`2nd.--Went to the meeting at Caroline, which was crowded,
and an open time,-- several expressed their gladness to see us again,
though very unexpected.

"`5th.--To Southland meeting, which was large.
I felt very poor and sat nearly or quite two hours in silence,
very different from the time we were here before.
The desire of the people seemed strong to hear words;
and although there was something arose to communicate,
it was to me a poor low time;--called afterwards to see a sick Friend,
and although I felt very poor here, yet on parting she said to me,
'I love you and have been refreshed.'`"

After an opportunity in a friendly man's family, with whom they put up for the night,
they pursued their journey and arrived at Mahlon Janney's at Hopewell.

"`7th.--Wait on your God, O my soul!
This place was the beginning corner for me this time twelve months ago,
when entrance into a large field of labour opened with clearness;
wait with humble submission to be rightly informed what you must do next.
It has been of late, a time of temptation and trial to me,
and I have had to feel what a wretched condition it is not to
experience the sweet presence of Jesus Christ our Lord.
But why should I complain?
Do not such dispensations prepare the soul for the
enjoyment of greater degrees of divine love and life?
O Lord, may what I have passed through, and what I may yet, in your sovereign will,
have to pass through, qualify me to live answerably to your goodness and truth,
if favoured to return to my house in peace; for you have been a God of truth to me,
your unworthy servant, in this journey.`"

In a letter written from Hopewell, Virginia, to his beloved friend John Pemberton,
he says:

I have remembered it was not far from this place, that you with other Friends,
were held in a state of banishment from all that was near and dear to you in this life,
and that the Lord's preserving hand supported you through and over all,
and restored you to your temporal comforts again.
Afterwards the Lord called for a free-will offering at your hand,
even to surrender them all again,
and become a sojourner for years in a strange and distant land;
and he has been with you in heights and in depths unto this day,
and has not forsaken you even in the most trying moments,
A sense of these things has caused my heart to rejoice on your account,
and also on my own, who am a poor pilgrim, and stranger in a strange land,
separated from wife and children, houses and lands, for the gospel's sake;
yet I am mercifully cared for by the Shepherd of Israel,
who puts his sheep forth and goes before them.
I have indeed great occasion thus to speak well of his excellent name,
for his goodness to me in this present proving journey.
Your kind attention and sympathy before I left home, as well as that of other Friends,
has been a strength to me.
Ah! what a poor, solitary, and I was going to say, benighted creature,
have I sometimes felt like,
before I have given up thus to leave all that is comfortable at home,
and run the Lord's errands; somewhat like a season of preparation,
wherein I could take but little delight in anything about me, or in myself.
But the Lord has made it up to me when I have cheerfully left all to follow him;
and my heart is tendered under a sense of his love while thus writing to you.
I believe I am afresh enabled to feel and sympathize with you,
with earnest desires that you may be favoured to live in a state of
dedication under all your provings for the gospel's sake;
most assuredly believing,
that a way will be made for you through the cloud and through the sea.
I have had near fellowship with you in your exercises when abroad on Truth's service,
when I have been with you,
and have looked upon it as an honour to take part with you as an elder brother.
I write with great freedom, for my heart is enlarged, and the love I feel is, I trust,
that which casts out all fear.

I know you have many discouragements in getting along, and think little of yourself;
and sometimes I have feared,
that the great discourager of the Lord's work would
willingly persuade you to think your gift little also,
less than many of your brethren.
Never did you do me more good as an instrument, than the day I left home;
and your extension of fatherly care to me at Shrewsbury
remains precious to me until this time,
and has been helpful to me in this journey.

Should this reach you in time, present my love to Mary Ridgway, Jane Watson,
Samuel Emlen, and Sarah Harrison;
+++[+++about to embark for England,]--may the Lord's
preserving hand be with them on the mighty ocean;
accompany the former to their outward habitations with sheaves of peace in their bosoms,
and with the latter as a pillar of fire and cloud through all their journey.

The harvest is indeed great, and the labourers few:
I think of my dear gifted brethren and sisters of Philadelphia,
with desires that more of them might give up to go abroad on the Lord's errands,
for we have received many favours, I mean the little company in that city;
and I believe more would be drawn abroad in Truth's service,
if the reasoner was shut out and barred against.
The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; yes,
mightier than the raging waves of the sea.`"

"`8th.--Attended the select meeting, and had a close searching testimony to deliver;
things appearing low.

"`9th.--Met with Hannah Cathrall, and companions Hannah Mitchell and Edward Garrigues,
who brought me letters from home.
In the evening we had a sitting with this family and a number of others.

"`10th.--In the fore part of the meeting today I was silent;
but in conducting the business I had my exercise respecting the low state of
things--the declension of the aged and the deviations of the youth.

"`11th.--We have the company of George Churchman and William Cole, of Deer Creek,
Maryland, and James Emlen of Middletown, Pennsylvania.
Met a committee of the quarterly meeting appointed yesterday,
to take into consideration the matter depending
between Hopewell and Crooked Run monthly meeting,
and the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania;
in which I trust I was favoured uprightly to discharge myself:
after the breaking up of the committee, I went into the youths' meeting,
which was very large, a number being out of doors.
Ruth Kirk and Hannah Cathrall had testimonies to deliver, of an awakening tendency;
after which, although in the other two meetings I sat peacefully silent,
I felt my mind drawn forth in a close and searching testimony,
from the parable of the ten virgins.
I hope on the whole it was a profitable and instructive season, although things are low.
Went to M. Janney's and dined,
and about the middle of the afternoon believed
it right to make some preparations for going,
as my way opens with some degree of clearness now after this meeting,
to proceed homewards.
We sat down with a large company of young and old, who came in,
and I took my leave of them in a solid and baptising opportunity,
and concluded to stay until morning.

"`12th.--This morning before we set off, came W. H. and wife to take leave;
we sat down together with the family, Hannah Cathrall and her companion, etc.
I had to speak of the many favours we had received, and deliverances in this journey,
and that my dear Lord and master had set me at liberty to return home from this place.
I had also to mention and commemorate the deep wadings
I had to go through in this place many years ago,
before my mouth was opened in testimony, and now I could reverently acknowledge,
that the Lord was in this place, although I then knew it not, as now.
Both S. Janney and Hannah Cathrall bore testimony to
the goodness of the Lord--the first with a belief,
that sheaves of peace would be our portion on our return; and the latter in like manner,
but with the caution, to rejoice in the divine fear, etc.,
that we should yet have to taste of the wormwood and the gall.
It was a precious time, and we parted in near affection.
Stopped at Joseph Janney's and had a baptising time with some of the children.
Crossed the Potomac to a house where they kindly refreshed our bodies;
and in a religious opportunity afterwards,
I believe the Lord refreshed and encouraged their souls in the way of well doing.
It was a precious season, both to parents, grandmother and children,
and encouraging to me in a sense that I am in my place on the way home,
so we left them peaceful and easy.`"

After this he had no further religious labour, but returned directly home,
where he arrived on the 15th of the sixth month, 1793; in relation to which he says,
"`I met an open, loving reception from my dear help-mate in life, mother, children,
and the rest of my family, after an absence of thirteen months, minus five days;
for which, and all other blessings and favours received at the Lord's hand,
my mind is bowed in thankfulness to Him who is worthy of obedience, glory, and honour,
and praise; who puts his ministers forth, goes before them,
and at seasons seals life and peace to their souls.
And although I know it is my duty to sit down in
this low condition spoken of by our blessed Lord,
'After you have done all that I command you, say we are unprofitable servants,
we have done no more than was our duty to do;' nevertheless,
it is in my heart also to leave this record, that I have lacked nothing:
the Lord has brought me through all my exercises,
I trust measurably to the honour of his great and holy name,
although many and singular they have been, even unto the banks of deliverance and praise.
And O, that I may be favoured still to remain under his heavenly notice,
protection and care, through the further probation yet to be met with,
unto the end of my days, and be counted worthy in the solemn close of time here,
together with my bosom friend, dear aged mother and children,
to rest in the kingdom of righteousness and peace,
with the generations of those who have gone before and follow after.`"

Under date of tenth month 6th, 1793, the following memorandum occurs,
which appears to be the first made after his return from the above visit;
giving a brief summary of his religious labours for some years previous,
and commemorating the mercy and goodness of his Lord and Saviour.

"`Ten years have passed over since I was laid on a bed of sickness,
and brought near to the gates of death.
It was indeed a very humbling, proving dispensation; inwardly,
because of great poverty and stripping,--and outwardly,
because of sore and long continued weakness.
But the Lord raised me up, and sent me into the back parts of New England,
and brought me home in peace.
Since that time I have been strengthened to perform a pretty general visit,
as before mentioned, to Friends in the government of New York,
with my beloved friend James Mott; and again,
into some of those parts with my beloved friend John Cox, of Burlington;
and on our return attended Rahway quarterly meeting, where I was singularly exercised,
and a sorrowful circumstance afterward occurred;
and also visited most of the little towns in that neighbourhood.
Shortly after, I visited New Jersey, in company with my friends John Cox, Nathan Smith,
and James Whitall; also Bucks County, with Nathan Smith.
Last year I went through the southern governments as far as Georgia,
accompanied by my dear friend Josiah Bunting,
who was a true yoke mate--returning from this
last long journey of nearly thirteen months,
in the sixth month last.
In all these I may humbly and with reverence acknowledge,
that the Lord was my helper and preserver through many and very singular trials,
and always brought me home in peace:
and now there is a fresh scene of trial open in this city,
such as neither we nor our fathers ever saw.
The awful messenger of death is travelling through the streets, as from house to house,
and removing from works to rewards, many not only of the inhabitants at large,
but also of the members of our religious Society, some of whom I nearly loved,
and who promised to fill up with propriety,
their stations in the church militant on earth.
Not a few of our brethren have left the city, so that we are reducing daily,
by deaths and removals into the country.
A sense of all these things has closely exercised my mind from day to day,
for some time past,
and I have seen nothing better than quietly to remain in my habitation,
where I have had frequent occasion to believe divine Providence has placed me;
and daily to feel after a qualification, through holy help, to say,
Lord preserve me on the living and sure foundation,
that my faith in your all-sufficiency may not fail.
You have been my protection and help through many trials, inward and outward,
in days past; and now, dearest Father, look down in tender mercy on me and my family,
and enable me, with the wife of my bosom,
to resign our own and one another's lives to you,
and if you are pleased to call for mother, son, or daughter,
O sanctify and prepare our hearts for such a dispensation;
or if in your unsearchable wisdom and mercy,
you are pleased to continue any or all of us a little longer on earth,
may devotion and dedication of heart be mine and theirs; and so your will be done.`"

+++[+++Thomas Scattergood remained in the city during the yellow fever of 1793,
and although some allusion is made to the disease in his memorandums,
yet it has been thought a more particular account would be acceptable,
and the following brief narrative has therefore been prepared.

So many years have elapsed since the general prevalence
of the yellow fever in our highly favoured city,
that but few of the present generation can have an adequate idea of the
alarm and distress produced by this awful dispensation of divine Providence.

This malignant disorder, which, in the space of about three months,
swept away nearly four thousand persons,
made its appearance in the latter end of the seventh month, in Water street,
between Mulberry and Sassafras streets.
It was some time before it attracted much attention,
but it gradually extended to Front street and other parts adjacent--
its greatest ravages being nearest the river Delaware;
and by the middle of the eighth month,
considerable alarm began to appear among the citizens,
many of whom fled to the country and other places,
where they supposed they would be secure from its attack.
The number of deaths continued to increase--during the eighth month,
the daily average was about eleven,--in the ninth month it was nearly fifty;
the greatest number being ninety-six, and on two other days eighty-one and ninety-two;
and in the tenth month it was nearly sixty;
the highest number being one hundred and nineteen,
and on the days preceding and subsequent,
one hundred and eleven and one hundred and four persons respectively, died.
When we consider the comparative smallness of the population in the city at that time,
it is not surprising that the steady progress of the disease and its
great mortality should have spread terror among the inhabitants.
The shops were shut up, the streets very much deserted,
so that few persons or vehicles were to be seen in them,
save the wheels on which were conveyed the dead to the grave,
and the persons who attended them.
All pomp and show at funerals were dispensed with,
and the remains of the most worthy and respectable citizens
were committed to the earth in the most simple manner,
and in the presence of few if any more than necessity required.
Pride and ostentation were laid in the dust,--the high and the low,
the rich and the poor, were reduced to a common level;
and the anxious inquiring thought of most minds seemed to be, "`Who will go next?
Will it be me?`"

The disorder being considered contagious, the fear of contracting it, in many instances,
overcame the feelings of natural affection;
and persons who had been accustomed to all the comforts and attentions which
wealth and the tenderest connexions in life could bestow,
on being seized with the malady were wholly deserted and left to die alone;
or abandoned to the care of mercenary nurses,
whose chief object was their own ease and emolument,
and who often neglected the unhappy invalids entrusted to their care.
Some died entirely alone, and the houses where they were, being deserted,
the first intimation that a dead body was there,
was the noisome effluvia it emitted while undergoing decomposition.

A person employed in carrying the sick and dead, passing along the street,
heard the cry of some one in great distress, and the neighbours informed him,
that the family had been ill for some days,
but that the fear of the disease had prevented them from venturing to examine the house.
The man cheerfully undertook the benevolent task, and on going upstairs,
he found the father of the family dead, who had been lying on the floor some days;
two children near him also dead; the mother, who was very ill,
gave birth to another child, which, with herself also died while he remained;
thus making five persons dead in one house at the same time.
This event, among many others of somewhat similar character,
will give a better idea of the awful and heartrending scenes exhibited,
during the prevalence of this humbling and distressing calamity,
than any description that can be written.
It is calculated deeply and seriously to impress the
mind with the weakness and helplessness of man,
when the judgments of the Almighty are poured out;
and also with a sense of his great mercy in sparing us
of the present day from such suffering,
not because we are more righteous, but because He is long-suffering and slow to anger.

The general consternation became so great,
that those whose particular province it was to have the oversight of the poor,
all fled except three;
and the distress and suffering among this destitute class of citizens became so urgent,
that a public meeting was called to devise measures for their relief and assistance.
At this meeting ten persons voluntarily offered
their services to aid the overseers of the poor;
and at a subsequent meeting others were appointed, making the whole number twenty-seven;
but owing to sickness, death and other causes, the work chiefly devolved on twelve, who,
with some others that afterwards offered their services, laboured daily,
with untiring zeal, in this work of benevolence,
and were the instruments of affording essential
benefits to their suffering fellow creatures.
Of the whole number thus employed, but one now survives,
our aged and beloved friend Thomas Wistar; his last companion, John Letchworth,
having deceased about a year ago.
Daniel Offley, an eminent and beloved minister in our Society,
impressed with a sense of religious duty,
and commiserating the accumulating distresses of his fellow citizens,
offered his services to the committee on the 30th of the ninth month,
and from that time continued to exert himself indefatigably in
this work of humanity until he was seized with the distemper,
which, in a few days brought him to the grave, deeply lamented by all who knew him.
A few days before his death, being in company with Thomas Wistar and another Friend,
when they were about to part, he solemnly observed to his companions,
"`The language of this dispensation to each of us is, 'You also be ready,
for at such an hour as we expect not,
the messenger of death may be sent to our houses.'`"
They separated never to meet again in mutability,
both the others dying in a few days.
Daniel Offley was taken ill on the 3rd of the tenth month,
and throughout his sickness evinced a cheerful serenity of mind,
being entirely resigned to the will of God, in whom his confidence appeared unshaken;
and on the 11th of the same month, in the thirty-seventh year of his age,
he quietly departed, to inherit a crown of glory that shall never fade away.

Charles Williams, another valued minister,
who was companion to Thomas Scattergood in his journey to Hopewell and Redstone,
in the year 1787, also died with the yellow fever on the 9th of the tenth month 1793,
aged twenty-nine years, and about the ninth of his appearance in the ministry.
Being of a tender and sympathizing disposition,
and his heart softened and animated by divine love,
he was a kind friend to the poor and those under affliction, whom he often visited;
and in the time of the great mortality,
he was much devoted to the relief and assistance of the sick,
to whom he was indeed a messenger of consolation.
The following memorandum made by him, is worthy of note:

"`Ninth month 1st, 1793.
It is affecting to observe the change which has taken place in this industrious city,
where business appeared to be the life of many,
and each one strove to exceed his neighbour in care to gather wealth.
Now a stop is put to this,--little business is transacted,
and the minds of many are awakened to consider what is
the state of their last and solemn account.
A serious solemnity appears on almost every countenance; and I hope,
by myself and others, this visitation may never be forgotten.`"

During his illness he was favoured with a blessed confidence in divine mercy,
which took away all fear of death, and his spirit departed to a better inheritance,
in peace with God and man.

A number of other valuable Friends, including several ministers and elders,
were removed by the disease, but even when it was at the worst.
Friends kept up their meetings for divine worship; and though they were often small,
yet they were crowned with a solemnity,
in some degree corresponding to the greatness of the sacrifice in going to them,
and were often seasons of humbling contrition.

A number of Friends whose minds were deeply exercised
with regard to remaining in the city or going away,
and who were engaged to "`seek the Lord, for a right way for themselves,
their wives and their little ones,`" had a clear
sense given them that it was their duty to stay.

The yearly meeting occurred during the time the disorder was prevailing;
and a number of Friends from the country attended,
being impressed with a sense of religious duty to do so;--and the
several sittings were considered peculiarly solemn and favoured.

Elizabeth Collins thus notices it in her memorandums:

"`In the ninth month 1793, I attended the yearly meeting in the time of the sickness,
called the yellow fever.
On seventh-day crossed the river and attended the select yearly meeting,
which was a good one,
our hearts being bowed in thankfulness to the Father of all our mercies.
First-day attended Newtown meeting to good satisfaction:
hearing some very discouraging accounts, +++[+++respecting the sickness,]
I felt great weakness and stripping, yes, leanness of spirit,
and my faith seemed taken from me.
Before I left home my great and good Master had condescended to inform me,
that if I would go and keep my place, my life should be given me for a prey,
and that according to my faith so should it be unto me.
I spent the night without sleep until near day,
when my faith again revived and I got some sleep:
awoke with thankfulness of heart to the Author of all good.

"`Second-day morning crossed the river with bowedness of spirit,
and attended the forenoon meeting, which was a solid time.
The representatives being called, but few answered to their names,
and from three of the quarters, not one.

"`Third-day morning at eight o'clock, went to select meeting,
wherein our hearts were bowed in humble thankfulness before the Lord,
for his abundant mercies bestowed upon us.
At three in the afternoon Friends met... this was a comfortable meeting,
several living testimonies being borne,
to the humbling of our hearts together into contrition and holy fear.

"`Fourth-day morning, some memorials of deceased Friends were read and approved,
tending to incite to faithfulness.
In the afternoon was the parting meeting,
a highly favoured season... we were favoured to part in that near fellowship,
which is not to be expressed.
May we be thankful therefor to the Author of all good.
This is a solemn time in this city, wherein many houses, great and fair,
are left without inhabitants, many faces gather paleness,
and many hearts are filled with sadness.
Many I believe, as was formerly recommended,
are standing as between the porch and the altar, crying, 'Spare your people, O Lord,
and give not your heritage to reproach.'
I have entered this city and remained in it without fear, except the fear of the Lord,
which at times tills the hearts of his humble dependent children.
May I be truly thankful for this and every other mercy.`"

Toward the latter end of the tenth month the disorder began to abate,
and in a few days the improvement was very striking,
the number of deaths being greatly diminished, the new cases very few,
and a great many recovering.
This was not owing to any assignable natural cause,
or to any new discovery in the mode of treating the disease,
but evidently to the immediate interposition of Him who, in the midst of judgment,
remembers mercy.
On the 14th of eleventh month the committee for the relief of the sick and poor,
published an address to their fellow citizens,
informing that the disease had nearly subsided,
and that the city was restored to as great a degree of
health as was usual at that season of the year;
and shortly after this it wholly disappeared.]


Thomas Scattergood's journal continues:

"`Tenth month 10th.--Felt a little revived this morning;
and after waiting until meeting time,
for my beloved friend Charles William's corpse to be brought past my habitation,
and it not coming in time,
I was most easy to go and sit with the little company at the market street house,
which was small indeed; S. Clark, Richard Jones and myself,
sat in the front of the meeting on one side,
Mary England and Mary Cresson on the other side of the house,
with some scattering ones over the meeting; amongst them I hope some precious youth.
I laboured in weakness, and am frequently jealous of myself,
as there has been hardly a meeting but what I
have publicly laboured in for the past month.
O may I be willing to be searched; and if it is my lot to be numbered to my grave,
may my merciful Lord and Saviour be graciously pleased to receive me.

"`11th.--Have been engaged in considering what are we,
amongst such an innumerable company of servants who are
doing their Master's will in heaven and on earth;
and why should such atoms mourn when the Lord of the universe is
pleased to remove some from the temptations and trials of time,
and gather them into rest,--seeing it is an easy
thing with Him to raise up and qualify many,
many more, and send them forth.
O for strength to offer up my all to my great and merciful Lord; that if life is spared,
it may yet be devoted to serve Him.
Dear Daniel Offley departed this life about ten o'clock.

"`20th.--A comfortable day, laboured in my own meeting, morning and afternoon,
and was favoured with an open opportunity in the evening.

"`23rd.--Called to see Rebecca Jones, who was seized with great pain,
and could hardly talk to me through extreme suffering,
though the day before she seemed bravely.

"`24th.--Dear Rebecca Jones appeared under much
discouragement respecting getting about again;
but was in a heavenly frame of mind and glad to see me;
telling me that I felt like bone of her bone.
On my telling her that I had not seen but that she might be
raised up to bear testimony to the Lord's goodness and truth,
she replied, 'I am a poor atom, unworthy to be employed in the Lord's work.
Dear Thomas, many have fled from the Truth, but the Lord will meet with them.
I have been an exercised woman for thirty years past,
and often grieved to see the pride and forgetfulness of many in our Society;
the multiplying of pleasure carriages, formal visiting, etc.;' and at another time,
when with her, she said,
'there is another dispensation in store for this people--depend upon it,
repeating it more than once, if the people are not humbled by the present.'

"`25th.--Went to Philadelphia monthly meeting, which was a comfortable time;
and most of those who were appointed to services being out of town and sick,
the business was summed up in one minute, except the answers to the three queries,
and the appointment of a number of Friends to join with the few left,
in the care of the poor and distressed.
I called to see dear Rebecca Jones, who lay with her eyes almost closed;
and although I spoke to her and took her by the hand, she answered not,
which was affecting.
After meeting I went again, and on going near the foot of the bed, she said,
'dear Thomas, I saw you, (alluding to the morning visit,) but I could not speak:
I am in waiting, there is nothing to do.'
She lifted up her hands, and seemed to wish to say more,
and several times gave us a look of much sweetness and love;
and at length looking up again, she said, 'Go and the Lord go with you.'
Being with her again in the afternoon, she said, 'dear Thomas,
if the Master renews your commission, and should send you over the water,
mind the time and do not deal it out to individuals, but spread it before your friends,
and you wilt find sympathizers; and when you get there,
remember the poor servants in families,
they are too often neglected--the Lord dealt bountifully with me in that land,
and I have had comfortable seasons with such.'
I asked her what she had in view in the morning when she looked up at me, and said,
go and the Lord go with you?--she replied, 'I could not tell you before J. J.,
though I love him, but I alluded to your going over the great waters.
The Lord has in some instances entrusted me with his secrets,
and I have not betrayed them.'
After some more conversation, she appearing inclined to sleep,
I left her with much sweetness, and could say in my heart,
that flesh and blood had not revealed these things unto her, but our heavenly Father,
for my confirmation and encouragement.

"`Twelfth month 4th.--About the time the last note was made, the sickness abated,
and now has nearly or quite disappeared.
Most of our Society and other inhabitants of the city are returned.
Dear Rebecca Jones was so well as to attend our meeting last first-day morning,
and bore testimony to the goodness and mercy of God;
but a different dispensation has of late taken place with me.
In the time of sickness, when fear and dismay spread over many,
my mind was wonderfully supported and borne up above the waves,
and I had faith at seasons to believe,
that if it had been my lot to be numbered to the grave,
mercy everlasting would have been my portion;
and in this sense I was favoured to rest my soul from one
season to another;--but leanness and poverty have succeeded;
and the enemy is permitted to come near,
insomuch that I feel like one waiting for some humbling dispensation to come,
in order to refine me.
O Heavenly Father, who have seen fit to honour your unworthy servant in days past,
led me forth, gone before me,
and have brought me back again with sheaves of
soul-enriching peace--what shall I answer you?
You have preserved my life in a wonderful manner--you
have entrusted me a little longer with a helpmate,
and lengthened out the lives of my children;
grant me clearness of sight and enable me to say, your will be done.`"

His mind had been exercised at times for some years,
with an apprehension that it was required of him to pay a religious
visit to Friends and others in Great Britain and Ireland;
and patiently abiding under the preparatory
dispensations for this weighty and important service,
he was favoured to see with clearness, the proper season for opening it to his brethren,
for their solid consideration and judgment.
It was during this period of preparation,
and before he had disclosed his prospect to anyone,
that his beloved and honoured friend Rebecca Jones,
had a sense divinely communicated to her of his being called to this engagement,
and as has been already related, imparted her feelings to him,
which appears to have had a confirming and strengthening effect upon his mind.

In the tenth month, 1793,
he spread before his friends of the Northern district monthly meeting,
this prospect of extensive and arduous labour in a foreign land;
which after solid deliberation was united with, and the requisite certificate granted.

Having obtained certificates of the unity and sympathy of the quarterly and
general spring meeting of ministers and elders in this concern,
he left Philadelphia on the 11th of the fifth month, 1794,
and next day embarked at New York, on board the ship Ohio, bound for Liverpool.
He was accompanied on board by several of his friends, from whom he remarks,
"`I parted with an overflowing heart,
willingly submitting myself to the care and protection of the Lord my God.`"
On the 13th they weighed anchor and got under way;
on this day he writes,--"`Met a kind reception from Judge Jay,^
footnote:[Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States to England,
who went passenger in the same ship.]
his secretary and others on board.
My cup has been full this morning, in remembering those I have left behind; and also,
what a pilgrim's life I have entered upon.
But who can describe the feelings on such a separation,
to one who is in such a lonely state as I feel
mine to bel O what would be the consequence,
was my Lord and Saviour to withdraw himself at such a time,
and leave me to combat with the weakness of the flesh.`"

The following extracts are taken from a letter written to him by Rebecca Jones,
dated 10th of fifth month, 1794, and endorsed, "`To be opened when at sea,
and recurred to in Great Britain and Ireland.`"

After leaving your house last evening,
my mind was swallowed up in that love and friendship which is better felt than expressed;
and now, in the greatest sincerity, and under that influence, my heart bids you 'Go,
and the Lord God go with you.'

When you arrive on the British shores, remember me, and pray for me when you can,
for though I have been, through the Lord's ever adorable mercy,
favoured to see for and feel with you, yet now under the prospect of a family visit,
I am ready to sink,
and very much doubt my ability to get through to the honour of my great and good Master,
being a much poorer creature every way than you have any idea of.

May the Lord on high, who is mightier than the noise of many waters,
be your bow and battle axe, your shield, and your exceeding great reward.
When you meet with my friends, say to them for me,
that my love for them and for the ever-blessed Truth, remains unimpaired;
but that being lately raised from the brink of the grave,
they must not expect many more written testimonials of my love to them; because,
being near the end of the painful journey of life,
I have less time and ability for writing,
and am strictly enjoined to salute but few by the way.

My sincere and ardent desire is,
that in those towns and places where Friends are numerous,
you may remember that valuable class in society, who are hired in families, called,
in that country, servants; among whom there is a number of valuable,
tender spirited Friends, with whom I had some precious meetings;
the remembrance whereof is pleasant at this moment.

And now under a renewed hope and persuasion,
that all things necessary will be furnished you,
by Him who has so evidently put you forth, my whole heart salutes you,
and bids you endearedly farewell in the Lord, and am your sister,
in unfeigned regard and true Christian fellowship.

P+++.+++ S.--Don't be afraid to trust your good Master,
if he enjoins upon you to hold meetings in the cabin;
he will make way for you in this and every other work he may assign you.
Do not be dismayed at the sight of the great, as you journey amongst them;
but quit yourself like a man, enduring hardness as a good soldier,
and the very God of peace and consolation be with you.
Amen,`"

"`15th.--What is man that you are mindful of him, or the son of man that you visit him?

"`16th.--My feelings have been much awakened at seasons since I got on board this ship,
and if I had not a small portion of faith left to believe that the Lord is on my side,
surely fear and dismay would be my portion.
How comfortable and cheering would the company of some
one of my dear friends now be as a companion.
How singular a movement from home it seems, to be put on board ship alone;
altogether among strangers, a stranger in the midst of the sea.
Well, the Lord was with Jonah when in a worse condition than mine;
may it be his blessed will to strengthen my faith, patience and confidence in him,
through this voyage, and be my leader and feeder on the land.
The respectful, kind treatment of judge Jay and my fellow-passengers,
is comfortable indeed.
Tears have been my food,
and probably might have been more so had I given full vent to them.
What an atom am I to attempt such a work--this is the greatest task ever assigned me:
O that the Lord my God may be pleased to be a husband to my dear wife,
and more than a son to my aged mother, and bless my children.

"`20th.--A moderate breeze yesterday from N. N. E., so that we nearly laid our course,
and I endeavoured with all my might to keep the faith and patience.
Retired to my berth with heaviness, and had a tossing night, not of body, but of mind.
O what will be the issue of all this deep and very humiliating scene!
My companions can be cheerful,
but the fresh pangs of death and sorrow which have taken hold on me this morning!
Have I taken heed to a false light in my setting off from home?
have I not kept in the patience?
Judge me, O Lord; rip open my heart! show me my condition as it really is in your sight.
Permit your servant to spread forth his hands and pour out his
heart towards your holy habitation--hear  in heaven,
your dwelling place, and forgive if I have sinned,
for you only know the hearts of the children of men.
Afternoon.--Faith, we are told, is the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen: my sight seems at times gone.

"`21st, fourth-day.--Had rather a struggling night in my lonely creaking bed-chamber.
A little more quieted in mind on waking this morning, which I have esteemed a favour,
and a little hope and confidence have revived while sitting on deck after breakfast.
O that I may be prepared through this proving scene, as a vessel rinsed and cleansed out,
and fit for the heavenly Master's use.
Surely pride is hid and I see what a poor, very poor, creature I am.
A fair wind last night, and today S. W.: spoke a vessel from Ireland early this morning,
bound for Philadelphia, six weeks out.
A pleasant, warm day.
The wind continues fair this afternoon: opened dear Rebecca Jones' letter,
received in twelfth month, J. C.'s in the same month,
and J. Hunt's written after he got home from the Spring meeting,
wherein he sends me the twentieth Psalm to peruse.
Dear Rebecca Jones mentions the same in hers,
and I am thankful that I can take a little encouragement therefrom:
this has been a day of the most light, ease and quiet of mind, since I came on board.

O Lord, what a comfort it is to be in the least favoured,
livingly to believe that every thing is the work of your Almighty hand,
and that you are nearer to your servants than they are to themselves.
Gracious Fountain of sustaining help,
I bless your name for this little portion of comfort vouchsafed to me,
a poor and desolate creature,
in the midst of the sea--be pleased to remember my dear wife, aged mother, and children;
my heart yearns toward them with tenderness and love.`"

The letter of Rebecca Jones, above alluded to, appears to be the following:

Dear Thomas,

I have been travelling with you in spirit for several days,
even before I received your plaintive note;
and as I do believe the everlasting arm of ancient, all-sufficient help is underneath,
in your present conflict, I feel a liberty in the truth to tell you so,
even in the language of dear John Woolman to Sarah Morris,
at a time when she was under a frying dispensation,
in the prospect of her being called to labour in a foreign land, namely that,
'He will bring you through more purified.'
So, my dear friend, lift up your head in hope,
as you have often encouraged me and others to do.
And just now, the substance of the twentieth Psalm occurs very livingly to my mind;
turn to it and read it,
and apply it as a portion which has opened for
me to send you in the love and life of Truth,
in which I salute you, and remain your poor and weak, yet affectionate sister,

Rebecca Jones.

"`22nd.--Light wind and fair, last night, and continues so this morning.
Slept pretty well, and awoke with some encouraging hope;
since which I have sat down in the cabin and penned a few lines to dear Rebecca Jones:
may sustaining help be near her, and all my dear friends left behind.
O Lord, grant a portion of bread this day to sustain my tossed mind!
Afternoon.--Cast down,
but hope not forsaken--home and near connections frequently in view.
I find retirement, in deep thoughtfulness, is profitable:
O that the children of men were more acquainted with such a state!
Acquaint yourself, O my soul, with God and be at peace.

"`23rd, sixth-day.--Strong wind at south,
and continues so this morning--we have gone from eight to nine and a
half knots--passed the Banks--a wakeful tossing night--Lord you have
been the strength of the poor and needy in all generations;
before the mountains were brought forth, or hills were made, you are God!
You have been strength to the poor and needy in their distress, a refuge from the storm,
a covert from the heat,
when the blast of the terrible ones has beat as a storm against the wall;
condescend to bear up my drooping mind,
and all such as are engaged to seek your face and do your will.
O Lord, cause your face to shine on my dear aged brother left behind;
guide him by the right arm of your strength through this vale of trials and tears,
and bring him to inherit your glory.
Let your will prove our sanctification and redemption.
O for a portion of sustaining bread this day!

"`24th.--An unusually comfortable night's rest in my confined berth.
O what a poor creature I look like, to go to that great city of London,
and without any companion.
Did ever any poor servant set out like me, and feel as stripped and as poor as I do.
'Lord, help me.
After dinner, I went to my stateroom and lay down,
where my mind was covered with sweetness and love,
on looking toward my dear connections and friends, both in the city and out of it,
whom I have visited in days past, in the love of the gospel.
Wherein the Lord helped me, showing me the time to go forth,
and also causing me to return with sweet enriching peace.
O that this may be granted through the present errand!
I have had such a hope, I trust a living hope,
renewed this afternoon--all things work together
for good to them that love God--so be it:
rest in quiet confidence, O my soul.

"`25th, first-day.--After breakfast, sat down with judge Jay and son, in the cabin;
and my mind was drawn into solid retirement,
wherein my spirit saluted my family and friends.
I remembered the North meeting,
and that my dear friends were collecting for yearly meeting at New York;
and although I dropped some tears on the floor,
I was a little comforted in remembering this precious passage;
'Thus says the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity,
whose name is holy,--I dwell in the high and holy place; with him also,
that is poor and of a contrite spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.'
Dare I, a poor worm, draw any encouragement from this?
O yes; although I confess my shortness and backslidings many a time, in a day of ease.
Guide me, O Lord, by your wisdom;
grant that I may yet be favoured to be directed by your Spirit.
You, whose eye goes to and fro throughout the whole earth and sea,
in order to show yourself strong on behalf of those who put their trust in you,
grant me an upright heart to the end of this arduous journey.

"`Afternoon.--A tossing time; some of the passengers are gone to bed,
and such as could sit up, went on deck, and it was pleasant to behold the sun once more,
which has not shone for some days past.
Saw a school of porpoises playing alongside and around the ship,
and some brown birds flying above the waves.
Methought what a life this is, to have no more comfortable resting place than a wave,
a boisterous wave of the sea;
and yet how comfortable it is made to these little inhabitants,
by an all-wise Providence; rest then, O my soul, in patience, in your present allotment,
believing you are where your all-wise Creator would that you should be;
who can in his time, which is the best, make things appear more pleasant.

"`26th.--Never more, I think,
even in the time of distress lately passed through in Philadelphia,
+++[+++from the yellow fever,]
has my spirit been broken than at seasons in my berth,
in looking over the graves of my dear brethren, who are removed from works to rewards;
and here am I, a poor worm, ransomed from death.
O the adorable mercy and goodness shown to me and my family, at that time!
May I, and all those that I have left behind, live in a sense of it,
that if we are favoured to meet again in this world,
it may be in a sense of the love and goodness of God.
How could I bear up under the dispensations allotted me,
were I not favoured livingly to remember,
that Christ Jesus our Lord was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:
how little many of the children of men appear
acquainted with the baptism that he was baptised with,
and with the cup of which he drank.
O that I may be favoured with a willingness to drink of it to the end of my time here;
and if a day of enlargement is granted, after this dispensation, that I may be humble.

"`27th.--But little sleep last night.
O for patience and contentment in the will of God!
Great are the privileges many enjoy on land and
it is to be feared they are not enough prized.
I often have mournfully to acknowledge, Lord I am poor and sorrowful;
shall I again be found worthy of the annexed part'? let your salvation set me up on high:
set me above my doubts and fears.
I have undertaken a great work, for which I feel my unworthiness, and my weakness.
Afternoon.--The wind high and the sea rough,
so that it was with difficulty we ate our dinners.
The captain told us a little afterwards, we were going eleven knots an hour.
It is a favour that we are carried along so safely and rapidly through the ocean;
'The way of a ship in the sea,' is indeed a wonder, and I am a wonder to myself.
Ah me, how little can I see before me:
it seems as though my condition resembles the sea now in view from the cabin windows;
wave follows wave, and billow succeeds billow.
Remember, O my tossed soul, that Jesus, your Lord and Saviour, walked on the sea;
and he has been with you and supported hitherto,--has rebuked the winds and the waves,
and caused a calm.
May my weary, tossed mind find rest in him.

"`29th.--A pleasant morning with a fine breeze,
and I have been favoured to look forward in hope.
It is a great trial to part with wife and children, father and mother,
brothers and sisters, houses and land; although of the latter,
possessing not so much as many enjoy;
but I remembered on laying down my wearied head to rest last night,
and now again it revives with some comfort, that our merciful Lord said to Peter,
'Such should have a hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come,
life everlasting;' that is,
if they were parted with for his sake and the
gospel's. O that I may to the end of my days,
be found simple-hearted enough to come under this description; then all will be well.
The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear him, and saves them.
What a favour to have faith in your most excellent name, O Lord my God!

"`How sweet is the remembrance of the labourers in the
harvest field now in Great Britain from my native land,
and how I have longed of latter time to see them and enjoy their company,
in the love and life of truth.
Lord, raise up and send forth more labourers from the land of my nativity,
if it be your blessed will; water your tender plants, and cause them to grow,
and make them fruit bearing branches in the living vine.
Let the sound of your everlasting gospel go forth unto all nations.
It is you who appoints unto every servant his portion.
You are served in suffering, as well as in rejoicing.
Whom have I to look to, or to trust in, but you, to keep and preserve me,
and open a way to the end of this present engagement.
I hope, I trust in you.

"`30th, sixth-day.--The wind shifted toward morning to S. E. and is now heavy,
with a rough sea and rain; but O, how sweet to be favoured to look upon Zion,
the city of the saints solemnity; how precious to believe in God, the Father Almighty,
and in Jesus Christ his son; and at seasons to be favoured with the communion of saints.
Surely there is such a thing;
for how sweet is the remembrance of some who are in their fixed, happy places of abode,
as well as those who are still on earth.
O that the Lord my God may be pleased to make me an instrument of good,
if it be only to an individual in Great Britain;
will it not be enough to compensate for all I
have undergone or yet may yet have to endure,
to be thus honoured as a servant of God.
O Lord my God, who have been my helper and support through many baptisms,
be graciously pleased to bless and favour my dear aged parent
with a more abundant knowledge of the way of peace,
that her last days may be her best days,
and the day of her death better than the day of her birth.

"`31st.--A squally night--a great stir on deck about twelve o'clock, taking in sail.
Our fore-topsail yard was carried away, and the sail torn to pieces.
It was a favour that I could lay quietly in the midst of apparent danger,
the waves rolling and dashing violently against the side of the ship,
and it is likely my little berth was below them.
But what is all this when a quiet mind is mercifully granted;
when balmy sleep puts an end for the present, to trouble.
There is a baptism into which the Lord is pleased, in wisdom, to introduce his servants,
a measure doubtless of the same cup that was
allotted to Christ Jesus our Lord and lawgiver,
for our sakes.
Do you not know, says the apostle, that as many as were baptised into Christ,
were baptised into his death?
What are all outward washings compared to a living experience of this?
O the unutterable misery of that soul from whom the Lord hides his face,
and because of disobedience and rebellion will be merciful to it no more:
and how little is this thought of by vain and heedless mortals.

"`Sixth month 1st, first-day.--Ship goes easy to day, not much swell, and some sunshine.
I have been sitting since dinner,
pensively musing and thinking of my family and North meeting.
My heart was broken into tenderness--how near my
dear friends left behind feel at seasons,
and how one and another comes into view.
O how desolate and proved has been the state of my mind since
I so preciously parted from my dear wife and family,
this day three weeks ago, when I could say,
in humble acknowledgment to the God of my life,
that he was my light and my song--my shepherd and I should not want.
Blessed be his great and holy name, in that he has vouchsafed a little to renew my faith,
opening to me Jacob's vision,--poor worm Jacob,
when travelling from his father's comfortable house,
in the wilderness of this uncertain transitory world,
was favoured to behold God's preserving power and providence, and his spirit was cheered;
also,
when the prophet's servant's eyes were opened to
see the mount full of chariots and horses,
he said, it is enough.
Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.

"`2nd.--A still night, and a fine calm day.
Began a letter to my dear wife, and feel comfortably resigned to my situation:
thanks be rendered where due.

"`3rd.--Light wind to day and ahead:
have sailed only ten miles on our way for the last twenty-four hours.
Some impatience appears among the company,
but I am thankful for a quiet and resigned mind.

"`6th.--The wind breezed up fair about twelve o'clock last night,
and this morning we are sailing about seven knots an hour.
I am thankful that I was resigned when we were becalmed,
and feel tranquil now that we are moving more swiftly towards our desired port.
The works of the Lord in bis providence over us, are just and equal.

"`7th.--At one o'clock one of the sailors aloft cried
out 'land,' which proved to be the Scilly Islands,
to the windward of us.
The captain has outrun his reckoning.
Several of our company are busy packing up to go on shore at Falmouth tomorrow,
and from there by land to London.
I feel pretty quiet, though poor, and do not see my way on shore yet.

"`8th, first day.--Awoke this morning poorly and have felt so most of the day.
We were in company with a fleet last night and this morning,
and the wind first dying away and then coming ahead,
were until near sunset before we came into Falmouth harbour, where John Jay,
his son and a few other passengers went on shore, in order to take passage by land.
The captain and all the rest of the passengers being gone,
I sat down in the cabin and poured forth a few tears,--but it has
been a time of solemnity to me since the ship cast her anchor,
wherein I trust I have experienced that which is an anchor to the soul,
sure and steadfast.
I remembered this precious promise, 'I will not leave you comfortless,
but will come again unto you;' so I can sit down alone sweetly composed,
and make this note.
Soon after making the foregoing note,
a friendly man came on board in G. Fox's boat with a letter from him,
kindly inviting me on shore, which was pleasant, as also the company of the messenger.
I wrote a respectful answer acknowledging his kindness.
He left me,
and I walked the quarter deck until the captain and steerage passengers came on board,
and he soon ordered the anchor up, and we put out with a fair wind.

"`9th.--Refreshed this morning, and felt comforted both inwardly and outwardly,
and my soul has been revived in a fresh and living
sense of the loving kindness of my Lord and Master,
which makes my lonely confinement truly pleasant.

"`13th.--Weighed anchor about eight o'clock,
and about two o'clock came to again at Gravesend,
the wind springing up fair just as we got under way.
This has been a day of exercise in approaching
near to the great city--O for sustaining help.
There are many beautiful spots along the river which please the eye.
In the evening, the pilots who had gone on shore came back,
and we weighed anchor about eight o'clock.
About twelve o'clock I awoke with the bustle and noise on deck,
and found they were coming to anchor, between Greenwich and Blackwall,
where we lay until nine o'clock in the morning.

"`14th.--I had an opportunity of seeing the city almost up to London bridge;
and although my situation on board was not the most pleasant,
neither some things which my eyes beheld on shore,
nevertheless I believe it was right that I staid in the ship.
Between two and three o'clock, Joseph Smith,
a kind Friend came and met the ship one and a half miles from her intended station,
and took me home with him,
where I found dear Samuel Emlen and George Dillwyn waiting for me,
and met an open kind reception from Joseph's wife, who is a daughter of Rachel Wilson.`"

Extracts from a letter to Rebecca Jones, begun at sea, near the banks of Newfoundland,
fifth month 22nd, 1794.

You have been so much the companion of my exercised mind since I came on board this ship,
and peculiarly so this morning,
that I thought I must salute you in that love which baptized us together,
when you were favoured through holy help to unfold my state to me,
and in which you have since been made as bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.
How shall I open to you, my dear friend, the feelings of my mind since we parted,
and particularly since I came on board this floating bark.'
Stripped of all enjoyment of the company of my beloved connexions and friends,
and delivered into the hands of strangers,
not knowing the face of an individual on board, except my kind friend John Jay,
and him I never saw but once before;
I have not language fully to express the feelings which
were awakened in my depressed mind,
after we put to sea, when every prop seemed to be knocked away,
and for some days and nights I was left to struggle
with a sense of extreme weakness and dismay;
yes, I thought not far from the pit of despair.
For although some of you who love me, and myself also,
thought the way clearly and plainly opened before me,
and I was favoured to part so sweetly from my dear Sarah,
my mother and the rest of my family and friends,
and felt cheerful and easy as I passed along the road,
in company with my dear friends who gave up to see me on board;
and even until I got into the ship, I felt like one pressing toward his home;
after all this, O the unutterable pangs which came upon me,
and continued for several days.
My condition was veiled, and in the depth of my sorrow I was ready to cry out,
'why have I done thus?'
In this mournful state of mind, I opened your affectionate letter and read and wept,
but seemed as though I could hardly believe so as to derive any encouragement from it.
Since then I have read it again, and also that sent me in the twelfth month,
and one from dear J. Hunt, in which he refers me to the twentieth Psalm;
all which I have read with a degree of encouraging hope,
the clouds of dismay having in some degree broken away,
and love to my dear friends sprung up in my tribulated soul.
O how near and dear some of you feel to me, now while I am writing--I pray for you,
that the Lord may strengthen your hands to war, and your fingers to fight;
support you throughout your present undertaking, +++[+++a family visit]
and be your exceeding great reward, when it is accomplished.
Still remember me, your poor brother,
and desire for me that I may experience all the old dregs to be rinsed away,
and through adorable mercy be made a clean and upright hearted instrument,
if favoured to labour in a foreign land--this is the desire of my soul.
Feed the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you an overseer;
and may all the faithful labourers be strengthened by the mighty God of Jacob,
and their feet be so established as not to be moved.
For those dear and precious children in the city,
who have been rightly brought forth in the work
of the ministry of peace and reconciliation,
my desire is that their feet may more and more be shod
with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
Never more feelingly, than since being under a measure of the dispensation of sorrow,
in this watery journey, has my mind been dipped into sympathy with the afflicted.
O may the Lord God of everlasting compassion, look down upon and help those everywhere,
who are helpless, and grant them that hope which will be an anchor to the soul.

Dear Rebecca, you have been and I trust remains to be a sister in sympathy with me,
and you wilt not reject the simplicity of this plaintive note--it
will give you to see that you are not alone in travail and exercise,
and verily I dare not believe otherwise,
than that it is more or less the experience of all the Lord's truly baptized ministers.

Sixth month 8th, he adds;

Just dropped anchor in Falmouth harbour--all the passengers are gone ashore,
as well as the captain with the letter bags.
After I parted from my kind friend John Jay and his son,
who are going to take coach to London,
I came down into the cabin and endeavoured to turn my
mind to the Fountain of all-sustaining help;
and living hope sprang up, which is as an anchor indeed,
sure and steadfast in the time of trouble, and which through this trying voyage,
has brought up my poor little bark to the winds and waves, and so far, through mercy,
I have lived through it.
While sitting here alone,
I have had sweetly and encouragingly to remember the gracious promise,
'I will not leave you comfortless,' etc.

I have received a kind letter from George Fox inviting me to come on shore to his house,
which was cheering to my lonely mind, as was also the company of the friendly messenger,
who brought it, especially when he told me there were many valuable Friends in the town,
and some of them just returned from yearly meeting.
But the captain having told me he should return soon, in order to set sail,
the wind being fair, I wrote a respectful reply, desiring my love to Friends.
And now being again left alone, I have thankfully to say in the secret of my soul,
'Good and gracious you are,
O you who are the helper of all them that look unto and trust in you.'
A living hope revives, that your words my dear friend, will in due time be made good,
that I shall find sympathizers in this land--so be it.

On the 20th he makes another addition--

On seventh-day last about two o'clock, Joseph Smith came on board the ship,
about a mile and a half from London bridge, and brought me to his house,
and both he and his affectionate wife, treat me as a brother.
Dear Sarah Harrison and Elizabeth Drinker, are in the city,
the latter very poorly and under the doctor's hands.^
footnote:[She died in London soon after.]
I have been at several meetings, but have not had much to say, and feel willing,
if it is the Master's will, to pass along so for a season,
and am earnestly desirous that my spiritual senses may be so exercised,
as that I may be favoured in the right time,
with a right knowledge of the beginning corner.
Fray for me that I may be preserved among this people,
who abound with temporal good things; that I may be kept in the littleness,
and faithful to the unfoldings of divine counsel, as it may be graciously opened.`"

"`15th, first-day.--Went to Grace-church street meeting, accompanied by George Dillwyn,
and was seated between him and dear Samuel Emlen--a sweet comfortable season,
although I had but little to communicate.
Samuel Emlen preached, mentioning the coming of Titus to Paul,
and how they were mutually comforted together.
In the afternoon went to Devonshire house meeting; silent on my part,
but a comfortable season to me--came home in the
evening accompanied by dear George Dillwyn,
and found various young people there, with whom we had a favoured opportunity;
dear George staid with me until bed time, and a pleasant evening it has been.

"`16th.--Towards evening, came Sarah Harrison, and her companion Sarah Birkbeck,
who staid and lodged.
They came upwards of twenty miles to see me, and it was truly a pleasant meeting.

"`22nd.--Joseph Smith took me to Tottenham meeting, which was silent.
In the afternoon attended the meeting held in the Clerkenwell school-house,
and had a comfortable time with the scholars.`"

After attending London and Middlesex quarterly meeting,
Ratcliff meeting and one with the scholars at Clerkenwell,
he makes the following memorandum:

"`29th.--Was at Grace-church street meeting, both in the morning and afternoon,
and laboured in testimony in both;
and at six o'clock in the evening went to an appointed meeting for servants,
apprentices etc., which was held in the women's new house;
it was very large and ended solidly and well.

"`30th.--No way opens out of this city,
and great is the openness toward me amongst Friends;
may my soul be preserved in humility and fear.

"`Seventh month 1st.--Went to Horselydown meeting, and although we were few in number,
it proved a precious season,
where both dear Martha Routh and I were much enlarged in testimony,
and in the close my heart was drawn forth in prayer for myself,
and those other exercised servants,
who have been sent across the sea in the service of Truth.
O Lord, support and bear me up under all the dispensations which you,
in your unsearchable wisdom, may see fit to permit to be my lot;
and sweeten all the cups you are pleased to dispense to my dear wife--what can I do less,
my most merciful Lord and Master, than submissively say, your will be done.

"`2nd, fourth-day.--Had a restless night, and a weeping morning.
I dare not say, if you deal thus with me, slay me, I pray you;
but preserve me I pray you O Lord; for your will has proved my sanctification hitherto.
Went to Grace-church street meeting, and though not large, it was an open time,
wherein I had fervently to labour, and dear Samuel Emlen told me after it,
that one of the elders came to him with tears and mentioned,
that even the same words had been made use of by me as had frequently been by him:
and that it was marvellous.
After dinner, had a favoured opportunity in the family.
I went on board William Rotch's ship with Elizabeth Drinker, accompanied by William,
and Sarah Rudd and Rachel Smith.
Elizabeth Drinker expressed the satisfaction she felt on board,
and that it seemed like a pleasant home for those that were permitted to go;
but as regarded herself,
she did not know but that Trophimus must be yet left at Miletum sick;'
alluding to Samuel Emlen's testimony at select meeting on second-day;
when he mentioned this passage in sympathy with her.

"`8th.--Went to the monthly meeting at Devonshire house, and during the part for worship,
I think we had a good time; I have not felt it more so, to myself,
since being in this city.

"`9th.--Attended Grace-church street monthly meeting,
and silently weighed a prospect which had rested on my mind,
to visit the families in this meeting; and at the close mentioned it, in much weakness,
before men and women separated.
It was united with, and a large committee appointed to make the necessary arrangements.

"`10th.--To the adjournment this afternoon,
where I mentioned Richard Chester as a companion in the work above alluded to,
with which the meeting united.

"`11th, sixth-day.--Dined at home,
(Joseph Smith's,) and had the company of Thomas Clarkson,
the great advocate for the liberty of the blacks.

"`12th, seventh-day.--Lord enable me to look with greater steadiness to you,
and to preserve the balance of my mind;
and O that I may seek counsel and strength from you,
so as to be rightly directed in this weighty work of going from house to house.
Unworthy as I am, I desire to prostrate myself before you,
and beseech you graciously to afford me the covering of your Spirit,
and a more even frame of mind.

"`19th, seventh-day.--A day of exercise;
no clear prospect opening to move in the family visit, and I am jealous of myself.
O for the water of purification, and that my soul may be abased,
and by abiding there find preservation!
Great is the subtlety of the enemy.

"`20th, first-day.--May I know a setting out anew this morning,
by the power of him who overturns, washes and makes up anew.
I am a poor creature, and I am glad to be made sensible of it.
Went to Devonshire house and sat silent;
dined with Martha Routh and company at Job Allen's; and when we sat down to eat,
it was a solemn time, in which my speech was directed to the parents,
their three sons present, and the maid.
In the afternoon went to Grace-church street meeting, which was dull in the fore part,
but after being favoured with a little strength to open a door,
Samuel Emlen had much to say to a number of strangers present,
and hope the meeting ended pretty well.

"`21st, second-day.--Breakfasted with Martha Routh, her husband, and several Friends,
at Simon Bayley's, and after a solid sitting, accompanied her on board the ship Barclay;
where I found dear John Wigham.^
footnote:[These two Friends were about embarking
on a religious visit to Friends in America.]
We had to part from them pretty soon, and the ship got under way.
After we landed, I stopped at the widow Smith's near the tower, with a number of Friends;
where we sat down together, and it proved a time of divine favour to be remembered.

"`22nd.--Breakfasted at Joseph Bevan's with Samuel Emlen;
and accompanied him to the water side, where I took leave of him in an affecting manner:
he was going, with a number of Friends, in a Gravesend boat,
to embark for America in the ship Barclay, After this, went with Elizabeth Minchell,
Sarah Rudd and Elizabeth Messer to Radcliff meeting, to the burial of Robert Forster.
It was a large mixed meeting, a number of poor inhabitants coming in;
and I was glad I was there.
On visiting William Rotch, the only passenger now left behind, and feeling his lonely,
tried situation,
I expressed a willingness to accompany him to the ship lying at Gravesend,
which he accepted.

"`23rd.--Set off in a post-chaise with William Rotch;
when we got to Gravesend found our friends on shore at a public house,
near the water's edge, all ready to put off, so we took boats and went on board;
staid about a quarter of an hour with them, and then took a solemn leave once more,
soon after which the ship got under way, with a fair wind,
and when we landed was nearly out of sight.
We sat down in the large room in the tavern,
and I hope we were favoured to send our wishes and prayers for
preservation after the little band on the water.
Returned with William Dillwyn, and as we rode along,
we saw a very great smoke arise toward London, which we found to be a fire.
It broke out in a boat builder's shop,
adjoining the East India Company's large warehouse and salt petre works;
which were soon on fire and burned violently.
It continued burning many hours,
and it was supposed that between four and five hundred houses were destroyed.
It came very nearly up to Ratcliff meeting house,
and extended over several acres of ground.

"`24th.--This was the day of Ratcliff monthly meeting, which I knew not,
but found my mind turned that way rather than to Westminster week-day meeting.
Joseph Smith went with me,
and when we got there we found the yard pretty much filled up with casks,
and no appearance of a meeting.
It being early we took a walk among the ruins and rubbish caused by the fire yesterday,
and in a little while returned, and found two Friends standing in the grave yard,
who hardly knew whether to go into the meetinghouse or not;
but I encouraged them to go in, so we went and sat down:
our meeting amounted to four members of the meeting on the men's side,
and two women and a child on the other,
with about as many from other meetings,--and a minute was made by a Friend,
adjourning the meeting for one week; the clerk we understand is burnt out.

"`25th.--Went to the meeting for the scholars at Clerkenwell school,
which was attended by only a +++[+++ew Friends, but hope it was to some profit.

"`26th.--A low time, in a sense of my weakness and unworthiness.
The prospect of a family visit is removed out of sight,
and it is proving to be here so long, just attending meetings as they come in course.
In conversation with my friend this morning, I find our feelings very much correspond.
This evening, on looking over the day, and also those days which I have spent in London,
what can I say or do more than the poor publican did?
We poor creatures can neither add to, nor take from the work,
O that neither carelessness, nor unwatchfulness, nor sloth may be laid 'to my charge,
I am jealous and afraid of myself.

"`31st, fifth-day,--To Ratcliff monthly meeting; which, although small,
I hope was an edifying time to some.
In the evening went to the Park meeting with Sarah Rudd,
which was the largest I have been at, and my mind was drawn forth toward the youth;
and yet, notwithstanding such seasons, what a poor stumbling creature I seem to be,
I laid down in pain and exercise, and had a tossing uneasy night.
I am a poor unworthy instrument,
if indeed I dare to number myself among the Lord's instruments.
I preach to others, and yet see my own shortness.
Lord, in your mercy, stretch forth your crook of love and tender compassion to me,
as you have done abundantly in time past.

"`Eighth month 3rd.--At Devonshire house meeting I was favoured with a sweet, calming,
refreshing time in silence.
E+++.+++ M. was there, and appeared after some time of silence,
and then I was favoured with an open time.
In the afternoon went to Grace-church street meeting, which was large,
and I hope profitable, my heart being enlarged and my mouth opened.
Returned home and sat a little while with dear Elizabeth Drinker, who seems to weaken,
but is in a precious child-like state of innocency.
This has been a comfortable encouraging day; may the Lord have the praise,
who can and does raise up as from the dust, and sets the poor soul at liberty.

"`4th.--My mind was thoughtfully exercised, before daylight this morning,
in regard to proceeding in the family visit,
laid before Grace-church street meeting a month ago this day.
A female companion has been waiting a month to join me,
and I have been shut up from going on, and this morning am still poor and blind.
O Lord my God, preserve me from joining in with anything which will mar your work!
I am poor and blind, you are riches, light and life: I prostrate myself before you.
I know not what step to take.
Lord, graciously condescend to the low estate of your servant,
and send forth your light and your truth, and let them guide my feet.

"`7th.--As I was going down from my chamber, I met Joseph Smith coming to inform me,
that they thought Elizabeth Drinker was departing.
I went into her room and found her almost gasping for breath,
but after a time she revived.

"`8th.--In my wakeful moments last night heard dear Elizabeth Drinker;
and sometimes she appeared, by the melody of her voice, to be singing.
I did not rise until late, soon after which, Dr. Fox came,
and I went into her room with him; and while we sat with her,
she appeared melodiously in supplication in broken sentences.

"`9th.--Dear Elizabeth appeared to me to be singing praises in the night,
and early this morning.
What a desirable state she is in!
O my poor soul, wait on your God for the discovery of his will and ability to do it.

"`Ten o'clock.--I have just left Elizabeth Drinker.
On sitting down by her, I asked if I should remember her love to Friends,
as I was writing home; she answered, 'Yes,
give my love--I love them:' and then turning from the subject, said distinctly,
'O the pearl gates!' After a few minutes I asked her if
she wished to send it to her dear husband and daughter,
she answered, 'O yes, let it go: with much affection and great earnestness.'
This morning when I went first into her room, she said in a broken manner,
'O my dear husband'--and then spoke of the wall of the heavenly city,
the gates and the hewing and squaring of the materials;
which bespoke where her thoughts were placed.

"`10th, first-day.--Dear Elizabeth Drinker is very low;
a little before meeting time I went up with the doctor to see her,
and apprehending she would not suddenly depart,
I ventured to go to Grace-church street meeting, which was large,
and my heart was largely drawn forth.
The doctor returned with me--found our dear friend alive:
I went to the afternoon meeting and was again enlarged in testimony.
While John Townsend, Joseph Smith and I were sitting by dear Elizabeth Drinker,
she seemed in a great struggle with the phlegm, and looked around at us,
and moved her hand as though she wanted to say something.
Soon after this she was helped out of bed, and before she could be got back again,
she very quietly expired.
I have been for days past, in a state of much weakness.
I am thankful, however, this evening, not only to feel pretty comfortable in body,
but relieved from considerable pressure and conflict of mind.
'When the dead are at rest, let their remembrance rest;
and be comforted for them when the spirit is departed from them.'

"`12th, third-day.--Feel more comfortable and revived in bodily strength.
O what a path I tread,
and yet what cause of reverent thankfulness that I am counted worthy to
labour and suffer for the Lord's cause! if I dare use the expression.
Labour to hold fast, O my soul.
Went to Devonshire house weekday meeting which
was held for the first time in the new house,
(women's,) and a very comfortable time it was.
In the afternoon Mary Stanton came to see me;
a young woman who was at the Peel meeting in the afternoon of the
first-day that I left Grace-church street meeting to go there.
It was a laborious and a low time,
but towards the close my mind was enlarged to such as were seeking the way to Zion,
with their faces thitherward;
and this young woman informs me that her doubts were answered that evening,
with respect to the attendance of our meetings.

"`15th.--At ten o'clock attended the remains of our dear deceased
friend Elizabeth Drinker to Grace-church street meeting-house,
where was a very large meeting: in the forepart, John Townsend appeared;
after which I had a pretty full opportunity.
We then accompanied the corpse to the grave yard, which was at a considerable distance.
There was a large collection of Friends and strangers at the grave,
and I had another opportunity amongst them.

"`17th, first-day.--Was at Tottenham meeting, which was pretty large,
and Thomas Shillitoe appeared in a very lively manner; protesting against the pride,
equipage and high things which so much prevail.
When he was done, my mind was exercised to stand up pretty much in the same line,
and I do not remember that closer doctrine has been delivered by me,
a poor unworthy instrument, at any meeting in this land.
The afternoon meeting was a time of binding up,
and my mind seemed enlarged towards the young people and little children.

"`23rd.--I hope my health and strength are recruiting:
O that devotedness of heart may be my happy experience.

"`29th.--Walked out this afternoon alone, bemoaning my present imprisoned condition,
and after I returned, withdrew into a room where my condition came more fully before me,
and in the thoughtful exercise, the state of the great city of London,
revived again and again; and on opening Cowper's poems this passage first struck my view;


'Cry aloud, thou that sittest in the dust,

Cry to the proud, the cruel and unjust;

Knock at the gales of nations--rouse their fears,

Say, wrath is coining, and the storm appears;

But raise the shrillest cry in British ears;`"

which seemed to correspond with the deep conflicts of my mind,
which has been ready of late to take up the prophet's language;
'Who has believed our report?'
what can such poor unworthy feeble instruments do to
put forward the work of the Lord in the earth?

"`31st, first-day.--To Tottenham meeting,
which was a time of enlargement and favour to me, and I hope profitable to others.

"`Ninth month 2nd,
third-day.--Spent some comfortable moments in William Dillwyn's office; being favoured,
I trust, with a ray of heavenly light.
Rode out about three or four miles before dinner and feel
better,--continue to take the doctor's prescription:
O that my heavenly Physician may condescend to heal me, and open my blind eyes.

"`5th, sixth-day.--To London and attended the meeting for Sufferings,
in which my mind was exercised to stir up Friends to zeal in
filling up their places in this important station;
and prepare for a day of suffering,
if it should be the great Master's will to suffer it to come.
Several other weighty subjects impressed my mind to mention, and it was a good time.
Returned home with my friends William and S. Dillwyn
after night--more watchfulness and prayer needful.

"`7th, first-day.--To Epping meeting, which was very small, but a memorable time to me;
my heart being engaged to come into a disposition to say, 'Not my will but yours, O Lord,
be done;' who will do all things concerning us well.
I had some religious communication,
and also in the afternoon--the latter of an encouraging character.

"`8th.--Feel a renewal of strength both of body and mind this morning:
may praise and thanksgiving be rendered to the Preserver of men.

"`Went to Chelmsford and attended the quarterly select meeting,--where I was
seated between my much esteemed friends George Gibson and Elizabeth his wife,
(formerly when in our country,
Elizabeth Robinson,) and the consolation and comfort
that my soul witnessed in this opportunity,
I cannot set forth.
I had to look back to my first acquaintance with this mother in Israel,
who was a mother in the Truth to me, who now sat near me in the meeting, and after it,
owned me as a child.
Truly the Lord provides all necessary good things for his devoted people.
A few months after she had returned from her visit to our country,
her husband was removed by death;
but her loss seems abundantly made up by her present one, who is a prince in Israel.

"`9th, third-day.--To the quarterly meeting, and although a very rainy time,
it was large, and I was comforted in the company of so many valuable Friends,
and an open instructive time I think it proved.
Dined at Robert Greenwood's with a large number of Friends,
and had a solid religious opportunity, my friends George Gibson and wife being with us.
What a favour, I have thought, to be thus noticed and cared for,
by one whom the Lord made as a sharp threshing instrument to me, in my own land.
The works of the Lord are indeed wonderful,
and his doings among men are hidden from the wisdom of this world.
I am a poor creature, unworthy of the many favours I receive;
and were it not for his abundant mercy, I should be confounded and consumed.

"`12th, sixth-day.--To a meeting at Tottenham, appointed for a marriage.
It was very large, many of the people of the town being at it;
and I hope it was a profitable season.
I went home with Thomas Horne, and when we sat down to eat,
a number of Friends being at the table,
I hope it was a good time to all of us in humble prayer.
After tea we dropped again into silence,
when this passage of the prophet impressed my mind; 'It shall come to pass in that day,
that the ploughman I shall overtake the reaper,
and the treader of grapes him that sows seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine,
and all the hills shall melt:' from which I had to
speak encouragingly to the dear children of the family,
as had been frequently the case before;
and near the close of the opportunity dear S. opened
her mouth in testimony to the goodness of the Lord,
It was a heart tendering time.

"`14th, first-day.--Went to Grace-church street meeting, which was pretty large,
and I was favoured with one more thorough open time, as also in the afternoon meeting.
Spent the evening with unusual sweetness of mind, and feel a renewal of bodily health,
even after such great exercise--what mercy.

"`17th.--Attended Grace-church street,
which was one of the most open meetings I have been at in that house.
The love of the gospel flowed freely towards the poor in spirit.

"`18th.--To the Park meeting appointed for a marriage.
E+++.+++ Bevington was there and favoured both in supplication and testimony;
and I hope it was to the profit of individuals present, as much tenderness appeared.

"`19th.--To the burial of Abraham Gray, at Winchmore hill.
This was a time of relief to me; wherein serious weighty truths were held forth.
Susanna Horne opened the service of this day to my comfort.
Jacob Bell and Sarah Rudd appeared in the grave yard,
and I had some further communication to make to the children of the deceased,
who were respectful and kind.`"

On the 19th of ninth month, 1794,
he was taken sick and confined to the house until the 28th. On the 26th he writes:
"`after dinner being alone, my heart was humbled into weeping.
O, the many trials there are to pass through, in order to refine us.
O Lord my God, you know all things, and know what is best for me:
not my will but yours be done.
Keep me in the work and service unto which you have called me, until you say it is enough.

"`27th.--Rather better in health--O for more living
substantial improvement in the things of the kingdom.

"`30th.--Went to quarterly meeting, which was comfortably conducted:
dined at Joseph Smith's with a number of Friends,
and think we were favoured both on sitting down to eat and after dinner,
with a singularly good time.
Let praise be given to the Lord most gracious.

"`Tenth month 1st.--At Grace-church street meeting; and although small,
it was a sweet season of the spreading of heavenly love.
In the evening went to the youths' meeting, held in Devonshire house:
it was large and solid, and the labour fell on me, and I trust it was an edifying season.

"`5th, first-day.--Feel pretty comfortable this morning, both in body and mind;
a favour calling for continued thankfulness.
What fathers and mothers, brethren and sisters,
are raised up to be helps and comforts to me in this far distant land.
Attended morning meeting at Tottenham,
and the testimony of Truth was close and searching to the libertines,
as has frequently been the case.

"`9th, fifth-day.--To the monthly meeting at Tottenham, and in the gathering of it,
my mind was covered with sweetness,
which ripened into an exercise that I was not easy to keep to myself,
and trust it was through divine favour, a time of love to some of us.
After dinner at Thomas Horne's, where there were a number of Friends,
we had a solid and instructive religious time,
and in the evening we were again favoured with divine good.
William Forster, his two sons, sister Ann, and Sarah Fairbank came in,
with whom we had another opportunity,
in the close of which Susanna Horne appeared in prayer.
Great and marvellous are your works, O Lord.
Be pleased to strengthen your servant to preach your word with all boldness,
in the name of your holy child Jesus.
This has been a day of enlargement,
for which unmerited favour may my soul be prostrated before Him whose
power remains sufficient to open when all appears closed up.

"`10th, sixth-day.--Thoughtfully exercised this morning, what to move in next:
sometime after breakfast felt liberty to send for T. Philips--when
the lad got near their door he met his wife and daughter Ann,
coming over to see us,
and soon after came Thomas also and Hannah Kendall--with this little company,
this family and Mary Reynolds,
I had an open encouraging opportunity from these expressions;
'many shall be purified and made white.'
After it was over, dear Susanna expressed a desire to accompany me to a Friend's family,
who had a son drowned about twelve months ago, on a first-day afternoon.
The lad was at meeting when S. E. and Elizabeth Drinker both bore a remarkable testimony;
Elizabeth saying among other things, that there was a person in the meeting,
who would be so suddenly taken, as hardly to have time to say 'Lord have mercy on me.'
Instead of going to meeting in the afternoon at his father's request,
the boy went to bathe in the river, and on the way one of his acquaintances said to him,
'we had better go to meeting,' but he refused and persisted in his design:
soon after getting into the water, he got out of his depth, and as he could not swim,
was suddenly drowned.
I went into this family quite a stranger, and soon after we sat down,
dear Susanna addressed the son and daughter present in an affectionate manner,
mentioning this awful circumstance;
also the trial of the family in parting with a beloved brother-in-law;
and hoped the dispensation might prove a blessing to both families.
Much brokenness of spirit appeared, and I hope it was a good time;
a door being opened by Susanna for me.
Returned back to Thomas Horne's, and soon after J. H. and C. B.,
who had passed the meeting yesterday, came and drank tea with us;
we soon as with one consent dropped into silence,
and I think it was a time that will be remembered by us all.
My path has been exercising in religious communication under this roof,
and the parents and children are made increasingly near to me.

"`12th, first-day.--One more favoured meeting at Tottenham,
wherein very close labour has been bestowed on the backsliders.

"`15th, fourth-day.--In a lonely walk this morning I felt some brokenness of spirit,
of which I was glad; the afternoon and evening were not so pleasant,
yet hope I have been measurably content;
but fear I do not experience that advancement and
firmness in the Christian life which is desirable.
My days are few and fleeting--O for greater religious improvement,
and more wisdom and stability.

"`16th.--Attended Tottenham meeting, where the corps of H. C. was brought,
on the way to the burial ground, at Winchmore hill, I had very close work, after which,
went home with Thomas Horne.

"`19th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting, which was large;
and a laborious time to me, in pleading with the high and unconcerned ones,
who will not come forward and join in the work of Truth.
In the afternoon meeting, my mind was drawn forth to a seeking state, and felt much spent.

"`20th, second-day.--Attended the morning meeting,
which was a time of sweetness and enlargement.

"`22nd.--To the burial of Rebecca, widow of Abraham Gray, at Winchmore hill,
which proved a solid time, and hope the meeting was held to profit.
After dinner my mind became exercised to labour with the company present,
to embrace the Divine call, and enter into the vineyard and work.
In the evening, had another religious opportunity with some Friends who came in,
which was an open encouraging time.
Truly I may acknowledge I am favoured, far beyond my deserts,
who am indeed a poor creature.

"`23rd.--To Tottenham week-day meeting, which was unusually small,
but solid and comfortable.

"`25th.--Set off in a post chaise for Hitchen, and arrived there a little before night.
I felt poor and stripped, much like a stranger and pilgrim on earth.

"`26th, first-day.--Went to the meeting, where I found a little company of Friends,
who were soon made near to me; my spirit was united with those, in every age,
who had no certain dwelling place,
and I was brought into near sympathy with the labourers and travellers in this day;
and after a time stood up with the subject before me,
and was favoured with an open encouraging time.
The afternoon meeting was to me a silent contemplative time,
wherein the book of prophecy was measurably opened to read in.
After meeting went to see that dear aged servant of the Lord, Samuel Spavold,
and it was precious to me to be favoured to sit by and converse with him,
and to receive his blessing.
He told me the Lord was with me, and that he hoped I would be preserved to the end.
'I longed to see you,' said he, 'after I heard you had come.
You sees I am a poor old man; I can't see you,
though I sometimes say see,--but I am glad to hear you.
The Lord has been wonderfully good to me, and I love him;
but sometimes I tear I cannot love him enough.'
On mentioning the trials and temptations to be met with, he said,
'don't fear the adversary, for perfect love casts out fear:
my divine Master has been wonderfully kind to me, and given me victory over him;
I don't fear him; and he has enabled me to say to him in time past, Devil do your worst,
I fear you not.'
After a little pause he said, 'for whose sake I know not,
but these expressions have impressed my mind, 'there is that which scatters,
and yet increases; and there is that withholds more than is fitting,
and it tends to poverty;' be faithful, and so farewell.'
Sometime after when we again entered into conversation, he said to me,
'don't take any burden away with you.'
After a little time he continued, 'the Lord, my Master, has been very kind,
and has given me enough to live comfortably upon--I have a dear
Master,' I told him that I had heard so in my own country,
and it was encouraging to me to hope and trust also, and endeavour to serve him.
He replied, 'yes, he will be with you; you are a favoured servant.'
This was after an opportunity with a room full of Friends, most of them young,
to whom I had something encouraging to communicate.
'I am going home,' said he, 'and I am glad of it.'
On my saying, heaven would be a happy place, free from all labour and toil, he said;
'with the church of the first born--the general assembly; I long to be with them.'

"`27th.--Went to the monthly meeting, and it was an open good time:
supped at John Ransom's with a considerable number of Friends; we dropped into silence,
and had, I hope, a solid meeting.

"`28th.--To Isaac Sharpless' to breakfast, and after it was over,
I trust the bread of life was broken amongst us; then to J. W.'s,
where we were favoured with a good opportunity, Mary Stacey being my fellow helper;
from there to Samuel Spavold's. O the sweetness that accompanied my mind while with him;
and after a season of silence, I kneeled down in supplication,
and my soul wrestled with the Lord our God for a blessing,
both to be continued to his worthy aged servant,
and for the continuation of it to me in this land, and that if I should in time to come,
be excused from labours and travels abroad, my soul might rest as his does;
and that the Lord would favour his heritage, and raise up labourers and send them forth.
The dear old man expressed his satisfaction, and told me,
he could not fully express the love he felt for me,
and for the labourers the Lord is sending forth; 'For,' continued he,
'His work will be carried on.
The Lord will favour and bless you.
Master will prevail--his work will go forward.'
We parted with much affection.`"

After visiting a few families, he took postchaise and rode to Hartford,
where he attended their week-day meeting,
and visited a number of families and some aged individuals,
and arrived in London on the evening of the 30th;
the next day attended the scholars' meeting, at Clerkenwell.

"`Eleventh month 2nd, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting,
and had a laborious time in caution and warning to Friends,
to endeavour to stand armed against the evil and trying day.
In the afternoon silent.

"`5th, fourth-day.--To Grace-church street meeting; a laborious, trying season,
both in the first and second meeting, but not altogether without some comfort.`"

Extract of a letter, written by him, dated Stoke Newington, near London,
eleventh month 6th, 1794.

"`I am now at the house of my friend Richard Chester;
an elder whom I chose to accompany me, when way might open,
to conduct me into the families of Friends
belonging to Grace-church street monthly meeting,
and who has been waiting for that purpose.
You wilt find by my letters, that I have had rather a singular path to step in,
having been landed several months, and no settled fixed line of service has opened.
Within a few days, some little opening has presented,
and we have been into some families; and although in much weakness and fear,
and not without some trembling at the prospect; yet so far, it has produced peace,
and a willingness is wrought in my mind to proceed, as Truth may open the way,
and I think it not unlikely that I may winter in and near this great city.
It is a place my mind was peculiarly drawn to, when at home,
and also the latter part of the time I was at sea;
a place in which peculiar exercise has been my lot, both in meetings and out of them.
O that I may be favoured to dwell so low and deep,
as to be enabled to leave it with that peace, of which my soul is in pursuit.
I have thought of late of my tour to the south,
and remember how the remote part of Georgia lay most on me,
and the covenant I entered into, at the time when you were my careful nurse,
that if the Lord would but raise me up, and give me to experience the sense of his love,
and go with me, I would follow him to the end of the land.
I magnify that divine hand and arm that went with and supported me all along,
and through peculiar exercises in that remote spot.
How the scene is changed; they were poor,
and I was brought nearly to sympathize and feel with men of low estate,
in their little cottages.
Now there is an abounding;--O the perfection, there is here,
as to outward beauty and comeliness!
Herein are trials that are fresh and new,--and I
think of dear Rebecca Jones' bemoaning language;
'I am by far a poorer creature than you have any idea of;
and doubt my getting through to the honour of the great Master.'
You may tell her, that I have occasion frequently to remember her advice:
'Be not afraid of the rich and great,' etc.
I may also say that I have been favoured at seasons to
penetrate through the shell or covering,
and find precious ones here and there;
and with such I have been permitted to drink of the brook by the way,
greatly to our refreshment.`"

In a letter to S. H., written about this time, he says:

"`I have frequently thought of putting my pen to paper,
and telling you a part of my trials, but could not until this morning.
O that the Shepherd of Israel may be your leader, enlarge your gift,
and make you a blessing to many.
Wait then, my friend, patiently wait under all your trials,
for the live coal from off the holy altar, to warm your heart and touch your lips.
This is what will make our words drop as oil,
to the strengthening of the true mourners and upright burden bearers.
Without a doubt you are called, and as you keep in lowliness and humility,
you wilt come yet more and more into the state of the chosen of the Lord:
'You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, that you might go and bring forth fruit,
and that your fruit might remain.'
O that like Moses,
you may be favoured to throw all glittering preferments behind your back,
and learn more and more what a Christian's life is, meditating in the law of life;
and then no matter what your conflicts and inward exercises may be,
life will spring up in the Lord's own time, and a testimony to his goodness,
mercy and power will be put into your mouth.
As poor as I have been, and indeed was on sitting down to write this letter,
faith has arisen with respect to you,
and the desire to hold forth the language of encouragement.
I might go on and fill my paper, but perhaps I have said enough,
especially when we look back and remember those precious
seasons of heavenly regard we have been favoured with,
when the canopy of divine love has been so remarkably spread over us;
which are frequently revived in my mind, and the language has arisen,
I trust in sincerity, O Lord, preserve the parents unto your everlasting kingdom,
and favour the children.`"

"`8th.--Richard Chester went to town this morning,
in order to pave the way for entering more fully
into the family visit in the city next week:
spent the morning mostly in reading the New Testament.

"`9th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting, which was large,
and a relieving time to me from these words, that rested on my mind to begin with:
'O that there was in them a heart to fear me, and to keep my commandments always;
that it might be well with them, and their children after them.'
Went to afternoon meeting, which was thought to be one of the largest almost ever known,
without notice being given.
My mind was sweetened with a sense of divine love,
and under this I had encouragingly to labour for the help of others;
a seeking seed being present.
After the meeting visited several families, and this evening I feel peaceful and easy,
and it is in my heart to return the tribute of praise to the Lord my helper.`"

From the 10th to the 16th he was closely engaged in visiting
families belonging to Grace-church street meeting;
but from this time to the 30th, the way being closed for further labour,
he remained in the city and its neighbourhood,
taking the meetings as they came in course.

"`30th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting morning and afternoon:
in the morning a laborious close time,
yet was favoured with a good degree of sweetness and ease, and felt comfortable after it.
At the breaking up a young man came and spoke to me, and acknowledged in a tender manner,
that his condition had been spoken to.
The afternoon meeting was large, and an open time with the poor of the flock.
Several Friends spent the evening with us, and I was favoured with a good time in prayer;
my burden is lightened; for this favour may thanks be given to Him who is ever worthy.
O it is good to be thankful in all states and conditions, even the most proving.

"`Twelfth month 1st.--This day begins another month,
and I feel like making a new beginning.
The old exercise seems passed away,
and I do not find condemnation for travelling so
far in this concern in the manner I have,
and so feel willing to resign up all.
O that the all-sufficient power of Him who makes all things new,
may be near to help me in future labours, travels and exercises.

Attended the select meeting, in which Sarah Fairbank appeared in supplication;
and when she arose, I believed it right for me to continue the same;
and my mind felt comfortable and easy after meeting.
I feel resigned to whatever my Lord and Master
may be pleased in wisdom to inscribe upon me,
and to perform what further labour may be right; either to pursue the family visit,
or other work in a different line.
Good is the Lord and worthy to be waited upon.

"`7th, first-day.--Attended Grace-church street meeting, which was large, open, I trust,
and favoured; as was also the afternoon meeting.
Had a good time with the family in the evening, and laid down fatigued,
but preciously peaceful and easy in mind.

"`10th.--Attended the monthly meeting of Grace-church street;
and it proved a blessed opportunity, and hope it was profitable to individuals.`"
In the evening he was taken sick, and remained so for several days;
and in a letter dated 15th of this month, after speaking of his indisposition,
he remarks,
"`You will find that I am frequently thrown back by indisposition and other ways;
but do not be discouraged,--I am helped along;
and though my detention has been singular in this part of the city,
I dare not doubt it has been in the ordering of divine wisdom:
and the sweetness of that soul-enriching peace, which is my portion,
(in humility be it spoken,) is more than an adequate
reward for all that I have had to pass through,
in order to prepare for the work.

16th.--Opens again the family visit.--"`Sat with Joseph
Gurney Bevan at eleven--an open encouraging time;
after which I had a remarkable opportunity with a woman Friend and her daughter,
from these words: 'The Lord is my judge,' etc,;
the daughter was affected so that tears rolled down her cheeks,
and the mother was also tendered.`"

From the 16th of this month, to the 6th of the first month, 1795,
he was daily engaged in visiting families;
in which he was favoured to administer to the spiritual states of individuals,
in many cases in a remarkable manner.

Having for some time believed it would be required of him to
offer himself to Devonshire house monthly meeting,
to go from family to family,
he attended that meeting on the 6th of the first month for that purpose,
which he thus describes;--"`A low time in the first meeting;
but I could not forbear to mention my prospect of a family visit,
with which Friends united, and appointed a committee to assist me in the work:
soon after which I went and sat a little time in the
women's meeting,--and mentioning what I had done,
several expressed their satisfaction and unity with the proposal;
which was encouraging to my tried mind.

"`7th.--This has been a day of sorrow and exercise,
having undertaken more work in this great city;
and it feels discouraging that so little fruit appears after
the arduous labour bestowed in this +++[+++Grace-church street]
meeting; yet I hope it will not be altogether fruitless.
O my weakness and poverty!
Who is sufficient for these things?

"`8th.--A comfortable night's rest, and feel rather more courage this morning.
O Lord, my helper, enlighten the eye of your servant, for in vain is the help of man!
Be pleased to favour me with ability to see and to do your blessed will.`"

From the 8th to the 13th, he continued engaged in visiting families;
and having received information of the death of Samuel Spavold, he went to Hitchin,
the place of his abode, to attend the burial.

"`15th.--To meeting at eleven o'clock, where the body of our deceased friend was brought.
It was a large, mixed meeting, and I thought a low time.
O for preservation on such occasions, when there is so much looking to instruments!
I followed the corps to the ground, where I could not forbear uttering these expressions,
with some little addition; 'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel,
and the horsemen thereof;' with a desire,
that the youth of that neighbourhood might be favoured to take
up the mantle of this faithful servant of the Lord.
Dined with the widow, children, and grand children, etc.,
and was engaged in prayer at the table.
After dinner, came in Mary Pryor and Sarah Rudd, who had some lively communication,
which opened a further door for me fully to relieve my mind.`"

On the 16th he returned to London, and spent next day mostly at home.
"`On the 18th attended Barking meeting,
where the body of John Harvey was brought,--the house
could not contain the people so as to get seats;
it was a pretty open time, and after it I had a good opportunity with the widow,
children and other relatives.

"`19th.--Went to London and attended the select meeting;
and on the 20th went to Horsleydown meeting, where I was silently shut up.

"`23rd.--After an open time of encouragement with a
number of females at the meeting-house chamber,
I sat with several clerks, etc., at the same place;
being the last opportunity laid out by the committee within this meeting,
(Grace-church street.) My weakness was great, but strength arose,
and I was favoured to relieve my mind; and after they were gone I sat down,
and in weakness and humility, looked over my arduous labour within this meeting;
and though sensible I am a poor unprofitable servant,
yet felt thankful in that enriching peace was my portion.

"`25th, first-day.--Attended Devonshire house meeting, both morning and afternoon,
and was silently shut up; it has been an exercising day to me.

"`26th.--Went to the morning meeting, where an exhortation to servants,
written by Job Thomas of Wales, was read, and a committee appointed to correct it.
In the evening I met them at John Elliot's, and it proved a time to be remembered.

"`27th.--To Devonshire house meeting, and was again silently shut up under exercise.

"`28th.--Attended Grace-church street meeting, and through divine favour,
my mind was supported, and I hope enabled to worship in humble silent prostration,
and was favoured with some precious openings.
O for more religious weight and depth! that so the divine blessing
may rest upon me through the future labours in this great city.
I have need to be baptized again and again for so great a work.

"`30th.--Went with Joseph Smith to the monthly children's meeting at Clerkenwell,
and was favoured with a pretty open time.
Meeting with my friends Thomas Horne and daughters,
I concluded to go home with them to Tottenham, where I met, as usual, much openness,
and we had a comfortable sitting with the family and several Friends.

"`31st.--Spent this morning in reading;
hoping that before long my divine Master will appear,
and set me to work again in his harvest field.`"

About this time he received a letter from his friend J. W., dated twelfth month 11th,
1794, from which the following is taken:

"`We often think of you, and sometimes talk about you,
since you have left your native land, your endeared wife and children,
and also your beloved friends; in many of whose hearts,
I believe you have obtained a large place.
I may acknowledge that it is cause of thankfulness to the Father of mercies,
that ever I saw your face and heard your voice, being as a tender nursing father to me,
even before you knew me outwardly,
but were made sensible of my inward state and condition,
and in the precious light of Truth, did seal instruction on my heart,
and afford abundant encouragement to me, to press forward in that high and holy way,
which, through divine kindness, and the teachings of the Holy Spirit,
has been cast up and made plain to my understanding.
Your testimony also greatly tended to confirm me in the
prospect which had been spread before the view of my mind,
in a very remarkable manner; that some day or other, the Lord had a service for me to do;
namely, to publish his gospel message to the people.
This was at a time when I had read very little in Friends' books,
was not joined with them in their holy profession, and knew but little about them:
and the first time you saw me and took notice of me, it afforded me much encouragement,
at a time when often under doubts and discouragements.

May I treasure in faithful remembrance the
several eminently favoured opportunities I have,
since that day, had in your company, and in hearing your testimonies,
which have been as marrow to my bones, or as cold water to a thirsty man.`"

"`Second month 2nd.--Went to select meeting in London, which was a memorable time,
though exercising to me.
The Address by Job Thomas being again read, it was concluded to send it to him to publish.

"`3rd.--To Devonshire house monthly meeting; and although low in the fore part,
it was a day of some comfort to me;
Friends conducting their business in much brotherly love.

"`4th.--Attended Grace-church street monthly meeting;
and in the fore part had a relieving time, though it was low water in the beginning.
The testimony of Truth was very close to such as had
neglected the visitations of their youthful days.
A memorial concerning our beloved friend Elizabeth Drinker was brought forward.
On the whole I seem somewhat relieved;
but it is remarkable how one thing after another detains me in London.
I love its inhabitants and travail in spirit for the welfare of all ranks and classes.

"`5th.--Set off this morning, accompanied by George Stacey and Rachel Smith,
to the burial of the wife of Simeon Hagan, at Staines,
and the corpse was taken into the meeting, in which I was shut up in silence.
Ann Crowley, a young woman, sat near me, and appeared under exercise,
but did not give up to speak;
and at the grave I thought she again appeared under a
concern to express something to the people;
so I took her by the arm and put her before me, and soon after she spoke,
and thus opened a door for me to labour.

"`8th.--To High Wycombe meeting, and was shut up in silence.
My strippings and provings of late have increased,
and I feel very little strength to minister to others,
the cause of which my soul is anxious to know.
The Lord can turn a barren wilderness into a fruitful field;
but I sometimes fear that I am in the circumstance that Moses was,
when the Lord met him by the way going towards the land of Egypt with the Lord's message:
it seems he had forgotten or neglected doing his duty.
My past condition sometimes comes up, and the prayer of my heart is,
that my divine Master may cause his light more and more to arise and shine in me,
that nothing, which is wrong may lay hid;
for I see heaven is a clean and pure habitation.
And now, O Lord my God,
graciously condescend to the low estate of your servant--open
the way and go before me in this land;
and if you do not go with me, take me not up from here!
O guide my heart and my tongue, that I may not speak a false vision in this land.

"`11th, fourth-day.--To Grace-church street meeting, poor and stripped.
The body of Frances, wife of Joel Cadbury, was brought there,
and the meeting was pretty large.
John Townsend opened the service, and it was once more a time of enlargement with me,
and I hope measurably, a tendering season.

"`15th, first-day.--The meeting at Devonshire house was pretty large,
and I laboured among them in much bodily weakness.
Saw a little light on the family visit.

"`16th.--This afternoon opens the family visit in Devonshire house monthly meeting,
accompanied by Simon Bayley.`"

The following letter, dated London, third month 1st,
addressed to his friend Sarah Harrison, at that time on a religious visit in England,
gives an account of his labours about this time,
and will serve to show the close fellowship which
subsisted between these two devoted servants,
while engaged in similar labours, to promote the cause of Truth and righteousness.
After acknowledging her acceptable letter, which came to hand a few days previous,
he says:

"`You have been favoured to hit the nail on its head in nearly every stroke.
What a blessing,
that one fellow servant should be so dipped into
feeling and sympathy with another at a distance,
and without knowing or hearing by outward information, as you say was your case.
My exercises, both in meetings and families, some of them at least,
I think have been singular.
I was favoured to get through Grace-church
street meeting much to the peace of my own mind;
having a kind, attentive yokefellow, and who continues to be my near friend.
In the opening and liberty I feel while writing to a dear sister,
I will give you a little sketch of my winding up in that business.

"`The last opportunity was with a little company of female servants,
who could not be seen in the families where they lived, held in the meeting chamber.
Felt poor, as if it was indeed the last running of the little oil; however, we were,
I hope, somewhat tendered together; after which, being left alone,
I sat down under reflections that one more arduous undertaking was got through;
and although I had to acknowledge in secret to the goodness,
mercy and power of the good Shepherd, in putting forth and condescending to go before,
yet I remembered also, what He told his beloved disciples on a like occasion;
After you have done all that I have commanded you, say we are unprofitable servants;
we have done no more than was our duty,' etc., and so wound up quiet, calm and easy.

After this I had a humbling dispensation to go through,
having some time before the finishing of this visit,
laid a similar prospect before Devonshire house monthly meeting, in much weakness,
and now had to look towards the accomplishing of that.
But, O the strippedness I was brought into; and the concern was so much removed,
that I could see no time to make a beginning.
While I was in this state,
+++_______+++ came to London with some prospect of joining me in the service of Truth;
but his coming did not relieve me,
nor open my way,--his mind having been turned towards Westminster meeting,
and he had let in thoughts, that mine would be so likewise.
I could neither see him to be the right companion for me in the work in Devonshire house,
nor a beginning corner for myself, and he was made sensible of it.
After he commenced his visit, my way opened, and accompanied by Simon Bayley,
an acceptable companion, I have visited sixty-nine families in the last two weeks.
And truly, I find, beloved friend,
that it is good to be plunged down into Jordan's bottom,
or deeply baptized into weakness, nothingness and poverty, previous to such engagements;
for way has since been made for me in a marvellous manner,
and ability given to relieve my exercised mind.
What a mystery is this!
Is it not a miracle,
like the running of the oil into the empty vessels borrowed by the poor woman formerly,
whereby she was enabled to pay her creditors.
I have felt more cheerful and easy since a way and means have opened to pay this debt;
but we know all the honour is to be rendered to
the everlasting Prophet and Bishop of souls,
who indeed is, and will be,
a very present help in the needful time to all that wait on him.
So dear sister, as you have been so favoured to encourage me, allow me to say to you,
and not without feeling,--Lift up your head in hope,
for surely the same good hand which has hitherto been near,
and enabled you to set up your Ebenezer, will not fail,
even though more such singularly exercising meetings may turn up, as you describe.
'Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication,
with thanksgiving,
let your request be made known unto God:' this
encouraging language occurs to offer for your help,
and I trust, for my own also, being often sensible of poverty.

I hope I shall not say too much; but truly, when I think of our situation,
as the only two messengers now on this island from America,
separated from all our near and dear connexions,
we may give way a little to those sympathetic feelings we are favoured with.
Approve yourself, therefore, and that with a willing mind,
a labourer that need not be ashamed--rightly dividing the word.
You know the fat and full must be fed with different food from the panting,
bleating sheep.
Alas! alas! how many there are of the first description, not only under our name,
but amongst the people at large, although the judge appears to be so near the door.
Well, dear friend, amid all which we may have to wade through for the Lord's sake,
I think I see, and hope I am not deceived,
that the strength of Israel is yet with his people,
and that the declaration of the prophet will be more fully brought to pass;
'The Lord will comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places;
he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert as the garden of the Lord:
joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.'
There are precious plants, even little children, in this city, who,
by keeping faithful to the Lord, will in due time have this song, or one similar to it,
to sing.
The Lord is blessing Zion; but O how poor and desolate she sits in this great city:
are not her sons found slain at the head of every street?
And for this I have mourned.
I might enlarge, but this is enough, perhaps,
to show you where my dwelling place has often been for months past.`"

He continued engaged in visiting the families of Devonshire
monthly meeting until the 17th. In this visit he had often to
commemorate the goodness of his divine Master,
for furnishing him with ability to speak to the conditions of those he visited;
as well as for the enriching reward of peace,
graciously vouchsafed in fulfilling the duty.

"`Third month 18th.--To Peel monthly meeting, and was silent in the fore part.
Ann Christy opened her concern to visit families,
and I waited to know my divine Master's will concerning me, but was quite shut up,
although I attended with some little prospect of moving in a like concern.

"`19th.--This morning I took coach and went to Ratcliff monthly meeting,
in the fore part of which I sat in a state of poverty;
but before the meeting ended felt an opening to speak to an exercised state present.
Went home with Joseph Smith; all my prospects seem gone again.
Am I not indeed an unprofitable servant?
It is well if I can say I have done all, and as it should be done.
I am a poor creature, yet am favoured to feel pretty quiet and resigned.
I desire to be a devoted servant.

"`22nd.--To Tottenham meeting,
and although I thought but little more of this turn into the
country than that it was pleasant to accompany an elder sister,
and get a little country air;
yet on the road my mind was impressed with a sense of the uncertainty of time,
and the dreadfulness of being taken in the midst of worldly joys and lusts;
and early in the meeting I stood up with this concern, and delivered it in few words;
after which several Friends appeared,
and mostly to the same import--and it was a memorable meeting; but my mind was sorrowful,
in a sense that there was a disposition to put it off.

"`23rd.--The select quarterly meeting was a very trying time;
I expressed some close things,
under a sense of a forward spirit prevailing too much in some.

"`24th.--To quarterly meeting, which was so large that the people could not all sit down.
There were a number of appearances, and I thought I could have sat in a low place,
with my mind and mouth in the dust,
for the sake of the little ones being brought forward;
but felt a short testimony of encouragement arise to this class,
and to those struggling under difficulties, etc.;
and again at the close expressed a desire,
that friends might be preserved under the weight and sense of Truth,
and be careful how and what they spoke.
At five o'clock attended the adjournment, which held until near nine o'clock,
and I had some very close things to say,
being sorry to behold an active busy spirit at work.
I am jealous and fearful of my own standing:--the Lord knows my state;
and O that I may be rinsed and washed from every stain, and preserved unto the end.

"`25th.--To another adjournment at the tenth hour, which held until near three o'clock;
passed through it without much to say,
in silent suffering on account of a forward spirit.
Went in to the women's meeting with my friend Richard Chester,
when he took in the Memorials concerning Elizabeth Drinker and Deborah Townsend;
and after they were read, I had a comfortable opportunity.`"

While in London he received the following letter from Ann Crowley,
an account of whom is contained in the seventh volume of the Friends Library:

Shillingford, Third month 24th, 1795.

It is not without a degree of diffidence that I
take up my pen to address a father in Israel;
but as my mind has at seasons been favoured with a glimmering hope,
through the many clouds of discouragements, that although many are my failings,
yet I do feel true desires to be enabled to tread in
the footsteps of the flock of Christ's companions;
I am encouraged to believe, that my beloved friend will receive a few lines,
although it come from a babe in the knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom,
in that love which nearly unites the children of one Father,
whether aged or young in years.
It is not from an apprehension of having much to communicate,
nor from a desire to draw unprofitable consolation from my dear friend,
that I am induced to address him at this time; but as I have, I trust,
in the liberty which Truth gave,
a little unfolded to him the exercise of my often discouraged mind,
I did believe it would not be altogether unacceptable,
to hear a little how it fares with his poor friend; who,
though often tempted to believe that she haS not yet known her
spiritual eye to be anointed with the true eye-salve,
nor her spiritual ear to be enough unstopped,
to distinguish the voice of the true Shepherd from that of the stranger;
yet can say she feels no greater desire,
than that she may be favoured clearly to behold the pointings of the divine finger;
and when seen, be enabled, by the assistance of the Lord's mighty power,
to be obedient thereunto;
that so she may indeed become a humble follower of a crucified Saviour,
although it may cost her the parting with a right eye, or a right arm.

After I parted with you in London, I went to Staines,
where I spent near a week with my relations,
though my mind was so oppressed with the weight of the prospect before me,
that I had but little satisfaction in the company of any,
even of my nearest and dearest friends.
I thought solitary places, where I could pour out my petitions to the Searcher of hearts,
and supplicate for the continuation of his merciful regard, aid and direction,
were safest for me;
well knowing that of myself I could do nothing that
would bring glory to my great Lord and Master,
or afford permanent peace to my own mind.
I continued to feel the weight of the exercise,
and as yet knew of no companion who was likely to join me;
but as I thought I felt at liberty to cast my eye a little round amongst my friends,
my attention was turned towards one in particular,
though I dared not write to her till I had weighed it, as well as I was capable,
in the true balance.
While endeavouring to do this, as my head was reclined on the pillow,
I suddenly felt a stop, and the weight of the exercise was taken from me;
but my mind was left in a state of depression,
for what cause I knew not--the only consolation I felt was,
that I could appeal to my heavenly Father, in this language; 'You know, O Lord,
that I desire to do your will.'
My mind remained in a mournful state till morning,
not being able to rejoice in the hope that a ram was caught in the thicket;
but felt as if some new trouble awaited me.

On rising in the morning, I found this to be the case, as I received a letter from home,
giving me the affecting information of my dearly beloved
mother being seized with a repeated paralytic stroke,
which so much affected her speech, as scarcely to be understood in any conversation,
and that the doctor apprehended a sudden change might take place.

You wilt, I doubt not, conclude this was a close struggle for nature to bear,
and needed a fresh supply from the bountiful hand,
to enable me to drink the bitter cup with patience and resignation.
But blessed be the name of the Lord,
he is pleased often to mingle sweets with the bitters, which proved to be the case now;
for, although on my coming home, I found my dear mother so very weak and ill in body,
that there appeared no room to flatter ourselves with an expectation of her recovery,
yet her mind was favoured with such a sweet calm,
and appeared so remarkably patient under 'her allotted affliction,
that I scarcely dared allow a desire to enter, that she might be restored to us again,
believing our loss would be her eternal gain.
You may conclude I esteemed it a great favour,
to feel my mind relieved from the load of exercise which had so long attended it,
and at liberty to pay close attention to a dearly beloved parent,
whose tenderness and solicitude for her children have been such,
as seemed loudly to call upon us to use all our endeavours to alleviate her affliction.
But I may tell my beloved friend in freedom,
that here I brought fresh trouble upon myself;
for as nature rejoices to shrink from suffering,
so I was now glad to shake off the prospect of being called from home,
and thought the will would be accepted for the deed,
and that my whole attention should now be paid to waiting on my dear mother,
and that I should be excused from doing the Lord's work.
O, such was the artful insinuation of the enemy of our soul's salvation,
to endeavour to draw my mind off from a strict,
watchful attention to the pointings of the finger of Truth.
Well, it is with sorrow of heart I say, he did in some degree gain his point,
for I got unprofitably from under the deep exercise which had so long attended my mind,
with the plausible excuse of performing my duty to a beloved parent.
This brought darkness over my mind, and deep distress; but blessed be the Lord,
after he had in great mercy, chastised with his rod,
he was pleased to speak peace to my soul, and I became instructed in the belief,
that he that loves father or mother more than the Lord, is not worthy of him.

All must be given up to obey the voice of Him,
who has an undoubted right to employ his servants and hand-maids,
whom he is qualifying to work in his vineyard, how and when he pleases.
I may now tell you, the prospect has again opened in my view,
and I believe my peace will be concerned in closing in with it,
though the time for moving is not yet clearly seen, nor do I yet know of a companion;
but a little faith arises that one will be found,
when the full time is come for the offering to be made.
Perhaps indulgent Goodness will allow me a
little longer time to stay with my sick parent,
who is still living, though in a very weak state, wholly confined to her bed.

"`26th, fifth-day.--Went to Ratcliff meeting poor and low,
but had an open time of encouragement, and my mind is a little raised;
near the close I desired Friends to inform their neighbours,
that I proposed sitting with them on first-day morning next.

"`27th.--Attended the school meeting, and after it,
was favoured with a good time with the boys and girls separately.

"`29th, first-day.--We found a very crowded meeting at Ratcliff,
and it proved an open time.
The afternoon meeting was also large and favoured: I stood up near the close,
and told them that I had seen that day good things in
store for the inhabitants of this neighbourhood,
if on their part they would embrace the visitations of the Holy Spirit;
and that as divine Providence had allowed a devouring
fire to lay waste their outward habitations,
and they were now raising pleasant buildings on the ruins;
so if they were willing to let the searching and overturning power of
the Lord lay waste their old buildings spiritually to the foundation,
and remove the rubbish out of the way,
they in due time would be favoured to be built up a church and people to his praise:
and testimony bearers would be raised up amongst them to promote the work.
In the evening felt spent and poorly, but comfortable:
let the praise for this day's support be rendered to the Lord my helper.`"

About this time he received a letter from his beloved friend, William Savery,
dated Philadelphia, second month 25th, 1795, from which the following is extracted:

Dear Thomas,

Perhaps it may have given you some surprise,
not to have received a line from me since we parted.
I waited to hear of your safe arrival, of which I was glad to be informed;
but it was only a short time before I left home with my dear companions,
to attend the Indian Treaty; and since we returned,
but few opportunities have occurred from this place.
I am persuaded you wilt be furnished with many excuses for me,
rather than place the omission to the account of any declension of my love for you,
or any lack of brotherly sympathy with you in your arduous engagements.
No,--my dear brother,
I can assure you that I felt more deeply for you when you were about to leave us,
than I remember to have done upon any similar occasion,
being no stranger to the tribulated path you have had to tread in this land,
even amongst your own people;
and I have no reason to believe that the general state of things, in a religious sense,
among those to whom you are sent, is such as to cause a less degree of exercise,
or a more easy path of labour.
I am not surprised to find that bonds and afflictions have been your portion;
for so it must be in every place where Christ Jesus, the Lord of life and glory,
does not reign--rejoicing cannot be the common or frequent experience of his servants:
yet through faithfulness, we may at times rejoice even in this;
that we are accounted worthy to suffer in some measure for his sake,
who suffered so much for us, that he might bring many sons and daughters unto glory.

I can readily conceive, my brother,
that your spirit will be frequently wafted across the mighty waters,
to visit your brethren and sisters of the North meeting,
who have you in frequent and very affectionate remembrance;
and I trust many of us will remain to be to you, and you to us,
as living epistles written in one another's hearts.
When we are favoured to draw nigh unto Him who sits between the cherubims,
may we mutually make intercession that his holy arm may
continue to be our protection and defence on every side.
We may with thankful hearts acknowledge,
that much brotherly love continues with those among us,
who put forth their hands to support the ark of the testimony;
but the riches and grandeur of this world, are leading many into captivity.
Our meetings are large, especially on first-day mornings,
when as many sometimes come as we can comfortably
accommodate on the men's side of the house;
and mercy and goodness still follow us beyond what we deserve.

Our very dear friends, Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young,
have been in the city during most of the winter,
and have visited the families of Friends in the lower meeting, +++[+++Pine street,]
accompanied by Nicholas Wain, until he was taken poorly.
They have often visited us at the North meeting,
and been largely engaged in very affectionate labour, which,
as I cannot doubt it has gained the approbation of all,
so I also hope it has been truly refreshing and fruitful of good to many.
They are greatly beloved by every rank in society;
have been much favoured in our crowded evening meetings,
and have had a meeting in the North house, and another in Pine street, of an evening,
for people of other societies, and truth's testimony was exalted in both.
They also held a meeting in the Jail, to which I accompanied them.
The poor prisoners, of whom there were about two hundred, were many of them tendered,
and some much broken; and indeed it was a solid favoured time.

I am anxious that you may not, as dear Samuel Emlen says,
abuse my fellow servant by greater exertion and more continual
exercise and labour than your bodily frame can support.
Let me remind you, that we serve not a hard master, or an austere man, as you well know;
therefore, embrace times of relaxation, as wisdom directs and opportunity offers,
in order to recruit your health; for I much desire after your labours abroad are over,
to have the pleasure of sitting side by side with you among our own people,
that we may be favoured to share together,
as has been the case in some measure heretofore, that inestimable peace,
which is the sure reward of faithfulness unto God.
My brother, pray for me, for Satan often desires to have me, that he may sift me as wheat.
My prayers attend you, and in dear unity, I continue your brother,

William Savery.

His bodily health having become much weakened by arduous labour and exercise,
and no religious service opening,
he retired to his friend William Dillwyn's in the vicinity of London,
with a view to recruit.
At the hospitable mansion of this friend,
and others in that neighbourhood and at Tottenham, he remained for three weeks,
when he returned to London, and in a letter dated the 21st of the fourth month,
after referring to the improvement of his health and respite from labour, he says;
"`I desire to attribute it to the mercy and condescending love of the great Shepherd,
who still sustains the character anciently given; I am the Lord that heals you;
which teaches you to profit; which leads you by the way you should go--surely I may say,
it was so on first-day last,
having laboured in Grace-church street meeting both morning and afternoon,
and to my admiration was strengthened to speak to a great crowd of people,
at the burial of an ancient Friend, (J. Hagan) in the evening,
in which I was exercised in a close and awful manner.

"`I am now out of business--have attended all the monthly meetings in this city,
and trust I stood resigned to labour as way might open.
My friends say I have need of rest to recruit my health, but for all that,
I am almost ready sometimes to let in the thought that I am too much of a loiterer,
when considering how much time has slipped away.`"

The following letter from George Dillwyn, dated Redruth, fourth month 18th, 1795,
will serve as a specimen of his laconic style.

Dear Thomas,

You and I correspond, in the letter way, like poor day labourers,
who have but little to spare to each other.
The sparing of that little, however, seems to be saying,
'if I had more you should be heartily welcome to it.'
For my part, when I have told my friends where I have been; where I am;
and (if I can) where I am likely to go,
the end of writing is nearly answered and my budget exhausted.
I may congratulate you on your finish at Devonshire house, +++[+++the family visit]
and was pleased with your retreat into the country;
though such little recesses from service often remind
me of a speech of the mate of the ship Pigou,
one morning to the sailors; "`come lads,
step down and get your breakfasts as quick as you can,
and then you will have nothing to do but to work.`"
I have mentioned to my brother that I am now engaged in a
visit to the families within the western division of Cornwall.
We have just finished at this place, and after staying to the meeting on fifth-day,
and a public meeting appointed for the inhabitants tomorrow,
expect to proceed to Marazion and Penzance the day following; but how afterwards,
this deponent says not.
Your affectionate remembrance of me and my dear Sarah is very acceptable,
and we hope will continue.
As to outward and visible signs of it, though we do not pretend they are objectionable,
we do not by any means consider them as essential to the
friendship most surely subsisting (and long may it continue)
between you and your sympathizing fellow-servants.

George and Sarah Dillwyn.

"`Fifth month 16th.--To the opening of the select
yearly meeting in London,--felt poor and unworthy;
sat in silent abasement and felt content in that condition.

"`17th, first-day.--Went to Westminster meeting in a low state of body;
and had an open time, particularly to the youth.

"`18th.--To the adjournment of the select meeting,
and at four to the opening of the yearly meeting for business.
Felt a willingness to bear my burden and exercise in silence, and did so for some time,
but at length seemed as though I could not avoid
bearing testimony against a forward active spirit.

"`19th.--A time of exercise, not only on my own account,
but also for the right moving of the yearly meeting.
Went to the adjournment at ten o'clock, and had something to say in the forepart,
expressive of my exercise that the meeting might be preserved solid;
which was in good degree the case.

"`20th.--The meeting for business at four o'clock, was a good time.
I also visited the women, accompanied by William Tuke, to my satisfaction.

"`23rd.--Ventured, although feeble, to go and sit the meeting,
which was the most solid time, I think, that we have had.
The minutes of the meeting for sufferings were read,
and the slate of the little society at Pyrmont, in Germany, came under consideration,
and Friends' attention was turned toward visiting them.
Dined at Thomas Horne's with dear John Storer and many others,
and after dinner I had a singular time of communication,
and my heart was measurably melted within me.
Lord keep me in the hour of trial, I pray you, if you allow it to come:
you know what is best for me.

"`24th, first-day.--To Devonshire house meeting, which was large;
Susanna Horne appeared in supplication, and I had a thorough time of relief.
To Grace-church street afternoon meeting; was very large,
many strangers not of our Society being there, with whom I had a full opportunity.

"`25th.--A humbling heart tendering morning to me,
with prospects of service opening to my view.
You, Lord, know what is best for me,--O how can I move a finger without your help.
O keep me firm on the ground of Truth, come what will.

"`27th.--I sat about an hour and a half with the committee on Ackworth school,
and withdrew weak and poorly--Lord support me to the end;
and if your blessed will is done all will then be well.
Went to meeting at the fourth hour, and soon after it was settled,
the clerk revived the concern which had been spread before a former sitting,
respecting a visit to the little company in Germany, which held some time;
and the way closed up for making such a visit,
and it was recommended to the attention of the meeting for sufferings.

"`28th.--To the last sitting of the select meeting,
where I had an opportunity pretty fully to relieve my mind,
and in the afternoon attended a special meeting for sufferings.
I am glad and thankful that my mind is resigned and easy.

"`31st.--Went to Tottenham meeting in poverty and a sense of much unworthiness,
and ventured to bend in supplication, and found relief.
I also reminded that assembly of the many opportunities I had had among them,
and that this was not likely to be the case again soon,
and probably some of them might see my face no more in this world.
I thought a solemnity spread over the meeting,
and several other Friends appeared in testimony, much to the same purport.

"`Sixth month 1st.--Went to London with William Dillwyn and wife, to morning meeting;
where were a number of country Friends.
I poured forth my tears in silence,
under a sense of how near the enemy was permitted to come,
in order to overturn and lay waste the work of Truth in my heart.,
'Blessed are the pure in heart;' this language has been frequently in my mind of late.

"`2nd.--To Devonshire house meeting, which was small,
but I hope a time of some comfort and encouragement,
and I found an opportunity to salute the youth in particular, and bid them farewell.

"`3rd, fourth-day.--Attended Grace-church street meeting,
and had a pretty open time to take leave of my friends.`"

Under date of sixth month 4th, in a letter to his wife, he says:

"`I was much exercised during the yearly meeting, and my health impaired,
but as soon as it was over I went to Tottenham, my usual resting place,
and spent a few days at Thomas Horne's and William Dillwyn's, and I am now, I think,
as well as I was the first week I landed.
While making a note in my diary to day, I was told there was one waiting to see me.
I found it to be a youth, who has of late attended Devonshire house meeting.
He appears convinced and turned in mind to the divine principle of light and grace.
My heart rejoiced in his company, and at this time rejoices, in that,
however poor and tried an instrument I have been in this land,
the Lord my helper is in some instances, in degree, crowning my labours with success.
The praise is His due:
I may not forget some of the baptizing opportunities I
have been favoured with in this great city,
and when permitted to behold some fruits, I feel encouraged.`"

"`5th, sixth-day.--Left London after breakfast,
in order to attend the quarterly meeting at Colchester.
Put up at John Kendall's, and here met with Ann Tuke and companion,
and a number of other Friends.

"`7th, first-day.--To meeting, and was favoured to pour out my exercise in public prayer,
and found some relief.
The afternoon meeting was large and mixed,
and I sat nearly or quite two hours in silence, and then a little opening presented,
through much exercise, and trust it was profitable.

"`8th.--Attended the quarterly meeting and an adjournment.
In which I had some service.

"`9th.--To the parting meeting, the labour of which fell on me,
and through divine help it was, I trust, a good solid time.
Dined at John Kendall's; after which many Friends came in,
and I had a full opportunity to relieve my mind,
to a state which I apprehended was under the anointing for
gospel service,--exhorting not to put off out of season,
but when the way clearly opened to make trial.
Parted with near affection from my dear friends Joseph and Rachel Smith and sister,
Mary Stacey, who came thus far with me; and accompanied by my friend George Stacey,
who has given up to go with me for some time, proceeded on our journey.

"`10th.--Attended the week-day meeting at Ipswich, and was silent:
in the afternoon went to Needham.

"`11th.--To Needham week-day meeting, and was engaged to speak a little, near the close;
and in the evening to an appointed meeting, in which I was silent.

"`12th.--To Ipswich monthly meeting:
heard that dear John Storer died on his way from yearly meeting,
within thirty miles of home.

"`14th, first-day.--To Ipswich meeting, and had an open time;
in the evening was a public meeting for the town's people, which was very large,
and although laborious, proved a good time: after which,
a precious season with a number of Friends.

"`15th.--In the evening at five we were at Woodbridge meeting,
where we put up at Benjamin Evans'. As I was sitting in
this meeting my mind was comforted in a belief,
that although there was the alarm of war and confusion in the land,
the Lord would remember poor desolate Zion, and in a time to come,
build up her walls and set up her gates: I had to mention my prospect to Friends,
and it was a sweet tendering time to some of us.

"`16th, third-day.--To Suffolk quarterly meeting, at nine o'clock, which held until two:
and to the adjournment at four o'clock.
It was an open time, wherein much encouragement was administered;
and although but a small company, there are precious plants among them.

"`17th.--To what is called the parting meeting, which was a sweet encouraging time;
and at the close appointed one for the town's people, at six o'clock, which was large,
but a very trying one.
O the thick darkness that covers the minds of many; however,
strength was afforded to labour.

"`18th.--To Listen, and put up at an inn: the meeting was an encouraging time,
and some tenderness appeared: after meeting rode to the widow Sarah Jessup's,
and after dinner we called the servants in, and had a good religious opportunity.
Here Ann Tuke's mind was impressed with a prospect of
having a meeting at a town called Oxford,
five miles on the way, and our kind friend Dykes Alexander and others,
went on to get a place.
To which we went,
and held the meeting in a large room at the inn,--it was filled up with people,
and though laborious, ended well.

"`19th.--To Beccles, and attended meeting; very few of the town's people came.
Here is a pretty neat little meeting-house, but religion very low.
Though I had to mourn the desolate state of Zion, on sitting down,
I thought that if I was the only one in the town,
I would cheerfully sit down in that place and worship; and I had to testify,
that when the Lord turns again the captivity of his people, Judah shall rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.
Had a religious opportunity with the family and such Friends as came in,
belonging to the meeting.
After tea went to Lowestoft, near the sea.
Dykes Alexander and others having gone before, to see after a meeting place;
and having found a large building which was fitting up for a play-house,
we held the meeting in it.
It was filled up,
and though there appeared a disposition to lightness and laughter in some,
at first sitting down, yet it proved a solid good time,
and afforded me much satisfaction.
We returned to Pakefield, a little village two miles distant, and lodged.

20th.--We had a small meeting this morning, which was open and comfortable,--some goodly,
sober looking people attended, and among them the priest of the parish,
who was exemplary in his sitting.
After dinner went to Yarmouth, about ten miles, near the sea.

"`21st, first-day.--To meeting, where I had to bear a remarkably close testimony.
In the afternoon meeting I was silent, but Ann Tuke appeared in a lively manner.
She had thought of having a meeting at a little village called Gall's-town,
and some Friends went to get a place to hold it in this evening, but could not succeed.

"`22nd.--Set off early, and got into Norwich by eleven o'clock, to select meeting;
and again to quarterly meeting at five o'clock.
The men met in one house, and the women in another, a mile distant.

"`23rd.--To the adjournment of the quarterly meeting, at ten o'clock,
which was a close time: I went also to the women's meeting and relieved my mind;
after which, retired to Edmund Peckover's,
being so spent as to conclude it not prudent to return to the men's meeting.
To a large public meeting at six o'clock.
Ann Tuke appeared, but I was shut up in silence, and sweetly contented.

"`24th.--To a large meeting at ten o'clock, in which I was engaged in the ministry,
much to the relief of my own mind.
Went to Joseph Gurney's, and dined with Joseph Gurney Bevan, wife, and others,
and had a satisfactory religious opportunity afterward;
there appearing something good at work in the minds of these young people.
May such seasons of love be blessed to them all.

"`25th.--In the afternoon went to Lammas, to an appointed meeting at five o'clock,
and it proved a distressing time; from there to North Walshara,
and lodged at John Ransom's.

"`26th.--To meeting about a mile out of the town, held in a neat meeting-house.
A number of the neighbours came in, and it was an open time: after dinner,
rode to Norwich, and attended the week-day meeting at six o'clock,
where I had a very close testimony to bear.

"`28th, first-day.--To meeting at ten o'clock, and had very searching service.
After lying down and being refreshed, went to the large meeting-house at five o'clock,
the meeting being put off from two to that hour by my request; it was very large,
and I was helped greatly to relieve my mind.
At night I lay down weary, but in peace.

29th.--Richard Gurney sent for us to dine with him, a few miles out of town;
where we found David Barclay, an ancient Friend, much afflicted:
after dinner had a religious opportunity, to the relief of my mind,
and then went to his brother John's; had a solid time with this family,
wherein all our little band, even William Alexander and George Stacey,
had some communications: returned home, and I feel a very poor creature,
having been humbled this day.

"`30th.--To the week-day meeting at Norwich,
wherein I was brought into a state of trembling,
and remembered the prophet Habakkuk:--I hope it was to profit.
Dined at Thomas Bland's;
and after being favoured with a precious parting season with the family and servants,
and a number of Friends, went about two miles out of town.

"`Seventh month 1st.--Had a painful time at Wymondam meeting,
being distressed with a spirit of infidelity.

"`2nd.--To Tivetshall,
and had a laborious season in pleading with the stout-hearted youth;
then attended an evening meeting at Diss, which was a comfortable open time,
from the subject of the patriarch Jacob's vision and journey, etc.;
after which had a memorable opportunity in a Friend's family: O may it be kept in view,
and improvement made.

"`3rd.--The meeting at Attleborough was held in a private house,
and was open and relieving.
After a solid time with the Friends belonging to this meeting and neighbourhood,
went to John Bouswell's.

"`4th.--To Mattishall, which was a low time, and did not seem much like a meeting to me:
I suffered in silence.

"`5th.--First-day, to the general meeting at Downham, at which place no Friend lives.
Stopped at an inn, and met a large committee of the quarterly meeting,
who were appointed to attend it.
But few of the neighbours came to the meeting,
and in the fore part of it my mind was opened to look back at the state of
the children of Israel in Egypt--at Abraham's vision respecting them,
when a horror of darkness overspread him--also the gathering of our early
Friends from different societies--George Fox being by himself on a hill,
and proclaiming the day of the Lord,
and the prospect he had of the seed of the
kingdom lying thick on the ground and sparkling,
etc.: and although here was great desolation, this meeting being gone to decay,
I had a comfortable prospect of a day approaching,
when the seed would spring as out of the dry ground and spread;
with which prospect I stood up and told Friends I knew not what we had met for,
but to see our nakedness, and for our humiliation.
Near the close I stood up again,
and I thought my testimony had some effect on a few individuals not of our Society;
though here, as also in some other places, some persons left in the midst of my labour,
who, I fear, are not willing to endure sound doctrine.
Went to Finsham, where there are no Friends, and had a large meeting in a barn,
I hope to profit.

 "`6th.--To a meeting at Swaffham,
consisting of only one family and some of the neighbours, and it proved a good time.
Then to an evening meeting at Fakenham, where there are but two members:
a person left the meeting while I was speaking concerning righteousness,
temperance and judgment to come; but another met me as I was going out of the house,
and said he hoped we should meet in heaven.

"`7th.--To the monthly meeting at Wells, where there were but few Friends,
and these in a weak state; but I was glad in finding tenderness,
and I hope some desire to improve:
after dinner had a solid opportunity with a number of Friends.

"`8th.--To a meeting at Holt; and though I went to it under discouragement,
it was a good time; many neighbours came in and behaved well, and some soldiers.
After dinner went to Walsingham, to an evening meeting in a public building,
which was large, and I hope to profit.

"`12th, first-day.--I have had a fatiguing time for weeks past,
and awoke this morning in a low and tried state of mind:
when I came down stairs found letters from my dear wife, son, and several friends.
Went to meeting at Bury,
and though at the beginning there appeared a small opening into the state of the people,
and I was ready to conclude that I might minister to them, it closed up,
and I poured out my tears until I wet the floor.
At two o'clock went to the afternoon meeting,
and there also bonds and afflictions continued upon me,
and though I was silent throughout, Ann Tuke appeared acceptably in the morning.
O Lord, remember me in your faithful love, and continue your good hand upon me,
that my soul may not faint in the day of trial.`"

At this place, the following letter from his friend, the late John Elliott, of this city,
was received.

John Elliott to Thomas Scattergood

Philadelphia, Sixth month 6th, 1795.

Dear friend,

I cannot let this opportunity pass without giving you a
token of my affectionate remembrance,
having often thought of you since you left us,
and at times have felt sincere desires for your preservation,
and that you may be supported from day to day,
and strengthened to persevere in accomplishing the arduous task you are engaged in.
If it was in my power secretly to assist in holding up your hands,
I should be glad to afford my feeble endeavours in that way,
but am sensible of my own poverty and inability;
being persuaded that it is only in proportion as we walk in the light,
that the true union and fellowship are to be felt.
Where this is really the case, I believe the outward distance whereby we are separated,
cannot obstruct the current of that divine love, which, when together,
has been known to flow from vessel to vessel;
and if we were always watchful and careful to keep out every thing of a defiling nature,
the consolating stream would undoubtedly be more frequently witnessed to circulate.
But the world and its cumbering cares have the same effect now,
as the labours of the Philistines formerly, namely, to stop up the wells;
which makes renewed labour necessary to dig them again,
in order to come at the spring of life.

It is indeed, as our Lord said, "`The cares of this life, the deceitfulness of riches,
and the love of other things, choke the good seed and cause it to become unfruitful.`"
I feel it to be so in myself,
and fear it is too much the case with many others of our Society,
both in this land and in my native country, where your lot is now cast;
a land that was eminently blessed about a century ago,
with the revival of the gospel in its primitive purity, after a long time of darkness.
From there were transplanted into this country, some of the choicest vines; but low,
both here and there,
instead of fruits being brought forth to the praise of the good Husbandman,
many wild grapes are produced, and much unfruitfulness is apparent.

Yet it appears the vineyard is not forsaken;
the labourers are sent forth from time to time with a renewed invitation,
and it will be comfortable to hear that they are favoured to
see of the travail of their souls and be satisfied;
but if that should not be the case so fully as is desirable, this is certain,
the faithful labourers will have their wages.

Our dear friend Nicholas Wain, is now about to embark for Europe,
and your worthy father-in-law, David Bacon, has given up to accompany him,
which I hope will be mutually comfortable and satisfactory,
both to themselves and Friends where they come.
I expect it will be so to you to see them;
and I believe I may say it is so much so to us,
(except the loss of their company and services,) that we are
made willing to part with them for the great work's sake.
If the way should clearly open,
and any of you find a draft of love toward the Friends in the South of France,
I hope you will not come home with a burden, for lack of giving up thereto.
I should be glad to hear of such a visit being performed,
which I have no doubt would be very acceptable to them.

"`14th.--Went to Mildenhall,
which proved a trying meeting to me in various
respects--very few members or others present.
It seems as though in some places the lame and the blind were the guards of the house,
instead of David's valiant men.
Mary Alexander, from Needham, rode with George Stacey;
she has joined Ann Tuke as a companion in further service in these parts,
and the public service fell on them.
I was plunged into deep exercise.
O what can be the cause that this has been so frequently the case of late.
Lord, favour with ability to offer up my will to your divine will,
that so the work you have allotted me to do may not be marred.

"`16th.--To the week-day meeting at Bury, which was open and comfortable to me:
I found enlargement of heart, and at the close appointed one to be held in the evening,
for the town's-people.
Ann Tuke and companion set off to attend an evening
meeting they had appointed about sixteen miles distant,
and we went to our meeting, which was well attended,
and my heart was enlarged to preach the gospel;
and the people behaved with much sobriety.

"`19th, first-day.--At Oakham.
I feel renewed in my bodily powers, by travelling and fresh country air.
O my gracious Lord and Master,
permit not the enemy to prevail and bring a
cloud over my mind--you know how it is with me,
and has been of late.
Sat the two meetings in silence.

"`After passing through Nottingham, Mansfield, and Chesterfield,
arrived at Sheffield on the 24th.

"`26th, first-day.--Went to meeting morning and evening,
in both of which I was exercised in testimony.

"`28th.--Got to Ackworth, and in the afternoon sat with the committee.

"`29th.--Attended the public meeting, which was very large, and laboured in it,
but mostly to people of other societies.

"`30th.--Sat again with the committee, and spent the day at the institution:
the business being ended,
many Friends left--in the evening we had a pretty solid opportunity
with several of the family and other Friends who came in to see us.

"`31st.--This morning the poor in the neighbourhood came to
get the broken food which Friends purchased of the inn-keeper,
and while I wrote a letter,
another Friend had a religious opportunity with them in the yard.

"`Eighth month 1st.--Took post-chaise to Tadcaster; after which,
to our friend Lindley Murray's, near York, where I met a kind reception.

"`2nd, first-day.--To meeting, and was silent; things appear low,
and I had a pretty deep plunge.
Went to the meeting in the castle, held with the prisoners,
accompanied by Joseph and Rachel Smith, etc.,
which was a pretty satisfactory time--was shown the tower from
which William Dewsbury preached to the people,
and one of Friends' books, among others,
which were presented to the prisoners in this place,
upwards of one hundred years ago--they yet remain for the same use.

"`3rd.--Spent the morning in writing drank tea at Henry Tuke's,
and walked on the walls of the city and crossed the water in a boat,
and then to his father's, and looked into the grave-yard,
where I was told John Woolman and Thomas Ross were buried.

"`5th.--To meeting at Leeds, which was large,
and my mind was exercised to stand up with these expressions,
'They spend their days in wealth,
and in a moment they go down to the grave;' and it
appeared right to plead with the rich and full.
After dinner we rode to Christiana Hustler's, at Undercliff,
and attended an evening meeting at this place, called Bradford,
in which I was much shut up and very poor,

"`7th.--Went to monthly meeting held near Todmorden, almost twenty miles distant.
I had nothing to say until near the close of the last meeting,
and then had to bear testimony against a contentious spirit,
in one who had been displaced as a minister:--returned to Christiana Hustler's.

"`8th.--Felt weary with my journey yesterday, and in a low spot this day throughout.
O for greater purity of heart and more of the spirit of prayer.
O Lord, allow me not to forsake you.

"`9th, first-day.--To the meeting at eleven o'clock--passed through it in silence.
After tea,
Christiana Hustler came and told me it was their practice to
call the family together on first-day afternoon or evening,
with which I united; and they were called in, and I sat with the company,
which was large, and after a time my mouth was opened,
and favoured with so much enlargement as to give some relief to my mind.

"`10th.--Nothing opening, spent this day with our hospitable friend Christiana Hustler,
and on the whole it has not been the most unpleasant,
but hope a little ray of light has dawned.
O what a brave thing to be truly resigned in patience and contentment, even in poverty.

"`11th.--Went to Manchester, and on the 12th attended meeting there;
in which I felt an exercise to prostrate myself in supplication on my own account,
and also on behalf of my fellow labourers in the harvest field,
both in this land and in America,
and that mercy and truth might be near to support those left at home,
and bear up under all trials which may attend them;
and also that the exercised children whom the divine Master is fitting, and has fitted,
to enter the field, might be preserved.`"

On the 15th he arrived at Liverpool, where he remained about two weeks,
attending the meetings as they came in course, although much indisposed.
On the 29th, he embarked in a vessel bound for Dublin, where he arrived on the 31st,
and was kindly received by Thomas Bewley and family.

Ninth month 1st,--He says, "`To the weekday meeting held in the Meath street house;
in which I ventured on my bended knees to pour out supplication for
support under the future baptisms to be met with in this land;
and it appeared to be a tendering season over the meeting,`" In a letter dated this day,
he says, "`My own conflicting tossed condition came feelingly into view;
I remembered what I had passed through for months,
when a language arose after this manner, 'O Lord,
help me to bear up under whatever you may be pleased to permit to come upon
me on this island;' and there was immediately an answer like this;
'have I ever failed you in the greatest strait?'
in which my soul was willing to lay hold of a little encouragement.
I remembered Jonah and his prayer, and opened the good book and read it at large,
as therein left, no doubt for the strength and encouragement of all such poor messengers,
from that time to this.
For when my soul fainted within me,
I remembered the Lord--and my soul desires to sacrifice unto Him in Ireland,
and to perform all my vows.

"`9th.--To Baltiboys meeting, which was but small; after which went to Ballitore,
to the widow Shackleton's; had a very wearisome night,
having rode the greatest part of the way on horse-back.

"`10th.--Very weary and sore;
went to meeting and sat in silence--dined at Abraham Shackleton's at the school,
after which visited an ancient Friend.

"`11th.--To Carlow monthly meeting, and in it I had a close testimony,
which was relieving to my mind;
and in the meeting for business felt fresh courage to appoint a public meeting,
which was filled;
and it was supposed that three hundred persons were unable to get into the house.
It was a satisfactory time to me.
Several officers of the army, soldiers,
and some of the principal inhabitants of the town, were there.
They behaved well in the house, but outside there was some disturbance, in consequence,
it was thought, of a desire to get in.

"`12th.--Rode to Castledermot to a meeting for the town,
but although Friends took much pains to go round and invite the people,
but few came--however, it was a good time to me:
I remembered how the Lord led his people out of Egypt, gave a law unto Jacob,
and statutes to Israel,
and brought them into the land of promise--that ail the days of Joshua,
and the elders that outlived Joshua, they kept measurably unto it; and after this,
when they forsook their King and Shepherd,
they were sold into the hands of their enemies,
and delivered again when they cried unto him in distress.
I had to mention what a low state of things existed in the days of Saul, when he,
with his little band of men stood trembling under the oak; how the Lord chose David,
and caused the state of that people to flourish under him,
and more so under peaceable Solomon;
when that dispensation came to its summit:--how the Lord raised up valiants in this land,
and his gathering, sustaining arm was near to support so long as they leaned upon it.
And I did not question but that precious seasons of mercy and love had been experienced,
even in that old house, which had not been opened but once for years,
no meeting being now held in it: yes, I thought even the steps before me,
that led into the gallery,
had been occupied by those who had broken hearts and contrite spirits.
But now, alas! how the crown is fallen from off the head.
Nevertheless, there was a glance into the opening of better days.
I remembered the day that William Edmundson spoke of,
when land was to be had there at a low rate,
and then there was a danger of Friends becoming rich and forgetting themselves,
which it is to be feared too many did in that day.
But O, precious was it, as I sat, a little to behold the opening of a day,
when oppression will be removed, and patrons of the poor will be raised up.
In that day the poor, even the poor amongst men, shall increase their joy in the Lord.
We dined at an inn,
and after it I returned to Ballitore in company with Thomas Bewley and A. Shackleton.
On opening William Edmundson's journal, I found that Friends in the beginning had sweet,
heavenly, refreshing times at Castledermot.

"`13th.--To the meeting at Ballitore, which was low in the beginning,
and too much of a restless state prevailed in old and young: however,
I was enabled to stand up, though in weakness, and after some close labour with states,
which I apprehended were present, I felt more openness toward the close,
particularly to the school boys,
and at the conclusion of the meeting appointed one for the inhabitants of the town;
and to my admiration the house was pretty full, and a number out of doors;
and I trust the gospel of life and salvation was freely preached and owned by some,
and my mind was much relieved.

"`14th.--Returned to Dublin.

"`15th.--Tried this morning with a prospect that probably I
must offer myself to go from family to family in this place,
which has frequently of late darted into my mind.
O for wisdom and an understanding heart to go in and out before the people,
has been the prevailing language since I awoke:
may I be favoured with a clear prospect of duty,
let it be whatever the Master may appoint.
Went to the monthly meeting held in Meath street.

"`16th.--To the adjournment of the monthly meeting, which was small;
about thirty-three Friends present.
Soon after we sat down I found some openness towards this little band,
which appeared like that of Gideon, reduced less and less:
I was led in an encouraging line,
and in the conclusion told them that I could not see my way out of Dublin,
and was willing to unfold my state and some
little prospect that had opened to stay awhile,
and to visit either some or all of them in their families,
or such other religious service as might turn up.
It was a tendering season; my certificates were minuted,
and they left me at liberty to proceed as way might open amongst them:
before the meeting closed I felt most easy to appoint a
meeting for the youth to be held this day week.

"`18th.--The meeting to day was an exercising time,
and no opening to minister until near the close,
when I spread my thoughts before Friends, after which I felt a little relief.
Took tea at Samuel Stevens', and as I went into the door of the parlour,
I cast my eye on a person who sat som distance from it,
but owing to the room being dark I could not obtain a full view of his features,
but was struck with his resemblance to my father-in-law, David Bacon;^
footnote:[He had recently arrived in company with Nicholas Wain,
a valued and beloved minister of Philadelphia,
who went on a religious visit to that country.]
and as I approached nearer he arose and met me,
when I found to my surprise it was indeed he.

"`20th, first-day,--At meeting today,
my mind was unexpectedly exercised to stand up with these expressions; 'I cannot,
I dare not, disbelieve the being of a powerful, just and merciful God.'
It was a season of relief and much sweetness;
more than I had before experienced in this land.
The days of my youth came into remembrance,
and the Lord's gracious dealings with me from my childhood;
and near the close this precious language came sweetly into view;
'It is finished:' when I was ready to query, what?
And although it is a very pleasant thing even for a moment,
thus to have the burden removed off the shoulders,
and a day of sabbath and ease experienced, yet I dared not to covet that it might last,
but rather that the Lord my God might be pleased still, as hitherto,
to preserve in and through all the trials he may permit, who knows what is best for me.
O how my mind has been beset at times since the yearly meeting at London;
and these words,
'It is finished;' was the language of the divine Master after a time of agony: wait then,
O my soul, on your God.
To afternoon meeting, and sat silently content--spent the evening at home.
What need to watch and keep the garment undefiled in conduct.

"`21st.--To an appointed meeting for heads of families,
which was an open relieving time to me, and I trust satisfactory to Friends.

"`27th, first-day.--To meeting at Moate, which was large,
and most of the labour fell on me, from the words, 'By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat down; yes, we wept when we remembered Zion.
We hung our harps on the willows in the midst thereof.'

"`28th.--To quarterly meeting at ten; the men met by themselves,
and it was a remarkable time to me.
I had to stand up with this language,--'When the
sons of God presented themselves before him,
Satan came also amongst them;' etc., and though such was my exercise in the meeting,
I had secretly to acknowledge that the Lord was good,
and a hope revived that I should not be forsaken in troubles and trials yet to come.
Went to the adjournment at four o'clock,--sat it through in silence:
Nicholas Wain went with David Bacon into the women's meeting,
and had a large and good time, and when he returned, spirited friends on to business.

"`29th.--To what is called the parting meeting, which was large;
and dear Nicholas Wain was favoured with a thorough, awful and awakening time,
in pleading with the free thinkers in our Society.

"`Tenth month 2nd.--I am shut up in spirit at J. Clibborn's, near Moate, and may say,
the pursuer seems at times near upon my heels,
and surely nothing short of the renewed extension of divine
mercy and love will keep and preserve--I can do nothing:
wait then, still wait, in patient resignation, O my soul,
and heed not what man shall say or think; the sufficiency of a gospel minister is of God.

"`4th, first-day.--To Moate meeting, and was enlarged, especially towards the youth,
and had to point out the dangerous situation some were in, and to encourage others;
and if I have been favoured to engage some one to leave the tree of knowledge,
of pleasure, or carnal gratification, surely my being shut up for several days past,
as in a prison house, ought not to be discouragingly looked at;
and if only for my own mortification and instruction, with reverence may I say, so be it.
Near the close I mentioned to Friends a prospect
of seeing their neighbours in the evening,
at five o'clock: when we went into the house it was crowded, and many could not get in:
and thanks be rendered to Him who is ever worthy,
he favoured me with strength to preach the everlasting gospel; the people behaved well,
and I left the house in peace.

"`5th.--A struggling, wearisome night;
and way seems opening this morning to go into some families.
Visited six, of which some were pretty open, and I had both encouragement,
exhortation and reproof to hold forth; but in the others was shut up in silent,
painful conflict.

"`6th.--After breakfast took a lonely walk in the garden,
when the very same prospects which have often come upon me, were renewed:
'He shall take of mine and show it unto you, and he shall show you things to come.'
Your wisdom, O Lord, is unsearchable, and your ways past finding out:
take not your love and forbearance from me, and it will be enough:
though sorrow may yet be my portion, forsake not your poor tossed servant.
Called to see most, or all the rest of the families that live in town,
and in some of them had something to offer.

"`7th.--To the monthly meeting; in the fore part of which, I was favoured with an open,
large time, of much encouragement;
and in that for business had likewise to speak encouragingly,
and I thought the little handful present were favoured with that which sweetens,
and some with tenderness and brokenness of heart.

"`8th.--Saw my way this morning to go toward Dublin, and set off,
and got twenty-two miles before night, and bore this day's ride pretty well;
sweet peace and comfort was my companion, so that I can now, this evening,
feelingly adopt this language, 'The Lord is good to Israel,
and fully rewards his servants:' my heart is thankful for such a renewed sense.
On sitting down quietly by the fire-side,
my mind was turned to look at the various baptisms and
conflicts I have had to pass through.
I remembered the tried condition I was plunged into but a few weeks ago,
on alighting from my horse and sitting down in this room; now a sweetness accompanied,
and with resignation, spread itself over my mind.
Often has Ezekiel's case come up into remembrance in this land,
when He who has an undoubted right to enjoin what he pleases, was pleased to say,
(and who dare say to Him, What are you doing?) 'Son of man,
behold I take away the desire of your eyes with a stroke;' and
even under this sore dispensation 'he was not to mourn,
nor let his tears run down, etc.'
And the query has arisen, if my heavenly Master should be pleased to do so by me,
could I support under the dispensation, and submit with cheerfulness?
Surely I may be indulged to offer a sigh, even at the thought.
The Lord knows best what is best for me,
and my soul is led with earnestness to covet the seal of his love and approbation,
come what may come, to the end of my probation here.
O what a favour to have this seal in the forehead!
And what is this?
has been a humbling inquiry.--Answer, 'The Lord knows them that are his.'
He knows how to keep his flock, and lead and feed them like a shepherd.
O then my soul lean upon him, drink down heavenly wisdom and instruction,
and crave assistance to do so in and through every dispensation yet allotted,
that your end may be peace.
Thus I seem carried along, and I hope, feel mercy and sustaining help near to animate,
yet know not what proving may come, or what step or baptism into usual blindness,
weakness and poverty, may be dispensed; though at present,
I see so far as to invite Friends of this place to come together,
and sit with me tomorrow.

"`9th.--To meeting at Edenderry; which was an open, good time,
and my heart was enlarged to my own, and I believe, to my friends' satisfaction.

"`11th,
first-day,--Ventured out to meeting (in Dublin,)
and although I sat pretty long in silent poverty,
at length I was favoured with a baptizing opportunity.
A Friend informed me, that accounts have been received,
that the yellow fever has broken out in New York.
Ah, what will the trying thoughts which have impressed my mind respecting home,
of latter months, amount to!
Mercy and truth are with the Lord, and forgiveness, that he may be feared.

"`13th.--An uneasy, painful night; lay much awake, and was tried with many thoughts,
and yet when spreading my trials before my great Helper, received this answer,
'Have I ever failed you, or what have you lacked?'
to which my soul was favoured with a degree of brokenness to answer, 'Nothing Lord.'
Went to meeting,
where my heart was uncommonly enlarged to speak to a state under trial and temptations,
and afterwards sat the meeting of business through, which was largely attended.
Here my heart was again filled with matter to deliver respecting discipline,
encouraging Friends likewise to stand shod and prepared for a day of sifting and trial,
believing even this people will be sifted.
Attended the adjournment at six o'clock, and sat it nearly through; it was a good time,
the meeting well attended,
and I hope the hearts of some of the young men were
stirred up to move forward in the cause of truth.

"`15th.--Attended a public meeting, and was disappointed in seeing so few gathered,
and more so, in sitting so long waiting for others--the house was not half filled;
however, it was a quiet, and I hope, solid meeting, wherein I got relief among those met.

"`16th.--To an appointed meeting at Sycamore alley,
which was larger than the one yesterday, but the house not full by many:
it proved a solid, good meeting, in which my heart was enlarged.

"`20th.--Went to meeting, which was a season of great enlargement of heart,
and through divine favour, I trust, a baptizing time:
left the meeting-house in much peace; after which,
a number of Friends came to our lodgings,
and here again I had to speak to the states of some present.
Let the praise and honour be rendered to the Lord,
the mighty helper of his poor exercised servants engaged in his work,
and may my soul be humbled.

"`24th, seventh-day,--To the national meeting of ministers and elders, which was a close,
searching time: here I met with my father David Bacon, and Nicholas Wain.

"`25th, first-day.--Attended Heath street meeting, which was large and crowded,
many not of our Society being there.
I was drawn forth pretty largely to preach Christ Jesus,
the word nigh in the mouth and heart,
as the only sure teacher and baptizer in this glorious gospel day.
Attended Sycamore alley meeting in the afternoon, which was likewise large,
and in the fore part I had a short testimony,
but the chief labour fell upon Nicholas Wain,
and trust it was a good satisfactory meeting.

"`26th.--To the national meeting for business at ten o'clock, which adjourned till four.
Here Nicholas Wain was concerned to speak respecting the fondness to collect manuscripts,
and copying and reading such pieces,
to the neglect of reading the Holy Scriptures and our ancient Friends' writings.

"`27th.--To the public meeting at Meath street house, where I had but little labour.
Nicholas Wain appeared, also Ann Robinson.
At four in the afternoon met a committee appointed to consider the state of Society,
and also at six o'clock in the evening.

"`28th.--Went and sat with the committee of the national meeting;
and when the state of Society came closely under consideration,
I felt uneasy with knowing it,
and told Friends that I had endeavoured in my travels
not to be anxious to hear things by the outward ear,
but to attend to the openings of Truth: so I left the meeting,
and Nicholas Wain followed me out.
Attended the burial of Hannah Simmons at ten o'clock.
There was a considerable collection of people, and I had an open time in communication.
To the adjournment of the national meeting at four o'clock,
which was solid and satisfactory, and concluded comfortably.

"`29th.--To the parting meeting, which was large and solid;
most of the labour fell on me, and it was a good time: after which,
the meeting of ministers and elders met for the last time, and it proved a solid season.

"`30th.--To meeting in Sycamore alley, where most of the public labour fell on me.
In the evening took leave of my father David Bacon, and Nicholas Wain,
who intend setting off for Cork tomorrow.

"`Eleventh month 1st, first-day.--To meeting;
where I was looking for contentment in silence; but soon after I sat down,
I felt such a flow of love, that I longed for the meeting to be gathered,
that I might ease my mind;
and once more was favoured with a full opportunity in a large meeting.
In the afternoon attended at Sycamore alley,
which I sat through in sweet refreshing silence.

"`11th.--On examination, though with thankfulness I can acknowledge,
that the good hand has been near to help this day,
yet am conscious that more care and circumspection in speech,
less quickness and fewer offhand remarks, would tend to more peace.
When I am off my guard, and slip but a little in conversation, it brings the rod.

"`14th.--I am tried with staying so long in this place; and yet see little to do,
and no way opens with clearness to move, if my leg would admit,
which has been sore so as to lame me.
Spent most of this day retired in my chamber, which was sweet and comfortable.

"`15th, first-day.--Feel much recruited in my bodily powers this morning,
and could say I felt no pain: went to meeting, and my heart was much enlarged,
and my tongue loosened, to the comfort of my own mind,
and trust to the awakening and encouragement of others.
Rode to Sycamore alley meeting, which was pretty largely attended by Friends and others,
and it proved an open time from these expressions,
'I am a debtor both to the Jew and to the Greek, to the learned and unlearned,' etc.

"`22nd.--Attended the meeting in Meath street,
which was again an open enlarged time with me, but felt poor after it,
and had thoughts of omitting the afternoon meeting, as my leg by using it,
appeared much worse.
However, I went in a carriage, and a considerable number of strangers being there,
was much enlarged towards them;
one of them came in the evening and acknowledged
that I had been made instrumental this day,
in opening his eyes and removing his doubts;
and that he could scarcely forbear standing up in the meeting to acknowledge it.

"`23rd.--Poor and stripped in mind and weak in body,
but I feel rejoiced that I am made to see myself such a poor creature.
O that the Lord, my heavenly Master,
may be pleased to support through all that is yet to be met with,
both in heights and in depths,
and ever give me to see that the grace and good spirit thus conferred on me,
with the added gift of utterance to speak forth his praise, is not mine but his.
O how great has been your mercy and kindness to me in this city,
you who are a Helper of your people.

"`24th.--Attended meeting, which was a sweet silent one, for the most part,
wherein my own family connections and friends at home,
and others came up into remembrance,
when I ventured to pour out my soul in supplication for my own and their preservation,
with the visited children of our heavenly Father in this place.

"`26th.--While sitting alone in my chamber this evening,
I poured out a few tears on looking towards my dear wife, children and mother,
with a secret prayer for my daughter Mary,
who is rising up into the slippery path of youth;
and what can I say more at such a distance, than 'your will, O Father,
be done,' whose power and divine presence is everywhere.
You have indeed wrought wonders for me--O that my dear
children may all be remembered in mercy by you.
Spent most of this day in my chamber, and on the whole it was satisfactory,
and with some comfort and consolation administered, for which I feel thankful.

"`27th.--Was discouraged from going to meeting, in consequence of my leg being painful;
but as J. S. and wife called for me, I ventured to go,
and it was in the fore part a sweet silent one to me,
wherein secret breathings were raised in my heart on account of those left behind,
and by giving way to silent mental prayer for a season,
I was strengthened to bend in public prostration at the footstool of divine mercy,
and after it, felt a language of encouragement to express in the hearing of my friends.

"`29th, first-day.--Attended both meetings, and sat them through in silence,
except near the close of the morning meeting, endeavoured in a few words,
to stir up Friends to a more punctual attendance.
This passage was uppermost part of this day, in meeting;
'I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.'
Joseph Williams observed in the morning meeting, that his state,
when about sixteen years of age, so revived in his remembrance,
that he was fearful of omitting mentioning it in the hearing of that gathering,
nearly I think, as follows: 'A Friend from America was then on a visit to this nation,
who was detained in the city of Dublin for some months,
and laboured from meeting to meeting.
In one of the meetings his testimony so reached his heart,
that it brought him under much exercise and conflict of mind,
which he endeavoured to struggle against and shut out.
Soon after this he obtained leave of his father to go into the country,
and there getting into company with his acquaintances,
he lost much of the savour of this visitation, and on his return back to the city,
was in hopes the Friend was gone.
When he went to the meeting again, he took a seat as near the door as he could,
that he might slip out; but the stranger being there, and being, as was thought,
the last meeting he would attend, Joseph remained, and his state was again spoken to,
and he was told of his trying to flee from his best friend, the Lord,
who was convincing him of the evil of his ways.
This opportunity was a blessing to him, and he said, probably if he had withstood it,
he might not have been favoured again.
He then exhorted some present, who were in the like condition,
not to put away the Lord's mercy and kindness to their souls.'
Dear John Abbott, I thought, had also a sweet testimony to bear.
Returned to my chamber alone, and after a time company came,
but my mind was much shut up under exercise--favoured
to drop the silent tear:--Jesus wept over Lazarus.

"`Twelfth month 3rd.--Set off about daybreak,
accompanied by Samuel Bewley and Robert Fayle, for our guides,
with several others who went with us a few miles, and lodged at Castle Bellingham.

"`4th.--As John Abbott and I rode along in the morning of this day in the chaise,
we saw a company of people following a corpse into a cabin;
John said he believed he must stop there, and I did not feel easy to let him go alone;
so we left the carriage in care of Robert Fayle, and went into the house.
The coffin was laid in the middle of the floor,
and the house much filled up with men and women talking Irish.
John requested them to be still a few minutes, which they did,
and then began to talk again: he again desired them to be still, but one of the men said,
we suppose you want to preach--we will not hear you,
go out of the house--and they began to push us out.
They pushed me quite out of the door, and in a little time John came out also,
there being a number out doors.
I told them, perhaps they might have heard something to their profit; but was answered,
'We do not want to hear you.'
John told them it was a solemn occasion,
and they ought to consider that in a little time they would have to die also,
when the soul must be either happy or miserable, to all eternity.
'Who sent you to preach?
said one.
I answered, 'Jesus Christ,' I was then asked, whose successors we were?
and I think I answered, 'Of Christ and his apostles,
and righteous men of all generations.'
'You are but lay-men,' said one of them,
'and I can pick out of this company those that are better preachers than you.'
I turned to some of the young men and lads present,
and said I believed the time was coming and would come,
when the children would be favoured to see better things than some of the old men;
for which I was accused as a liar, by an old man.
I observed to them, that our minds were turned in love to them,
that seeing they would not hear us, we would leave them,
which we did with sorrowful hearts, being grieved with such blindness and prejudice.
We got to our friend James Christy's after night,
where we met with Anne Taverner and Susan Bewley.

"`5th.--Rode to Lurgan with Anne Taverner to select quarterly meeting at one o'clock;
it was a close time.

"`7th.--To the meeting for business: the women met apart,
and I got some relief amongst them in both meetings.
A committee was appointed to consider the state of Society,
and the meeting adjourned until four o'clock, when our certificates were read.
In the evening I felt a sweet calm over my mind.

"`8th.--Met the committee, and had an exercising time in considering the state of Society.
It was proposed to nominate a few Friends to visit the monthly and preparative meetings,
etc., and I felt a necessity to offer myself to join them,
after which John Abbott expressed a similar prospect;
it was laid before the quarterly meeting and united with.

"`9th.--Met the school committee at nine o'clock,
and went to the parting meeting at eleven, in which I was silent.
Sat with the committee of men and women Friends, in order to see our way to move,
wherein I was concerned to pray for us all.`"

On the 12th, in company with the committee,
they attended the preparative meeting at Lisburn; on the 15th to Mile-cross and Belfast.
18th, to Hillsborough preparative meeting.
19th, to Ballinderry preparative meeting, 20th, first-day, to Lisburn,
and the next day to the monthly meeting.
On the 23rd went to Rathfriland, and the next day attended that meeting,
where there were but three men and one lad, and about as many women;
although things looked discouraging, on the whole it was a good, and in some degree,
a tendering time; and on the 26th went to their preparative meeting at Lurgan.
28th, to Moyallen, and in the evening had a conference,
in which our way appeared closed up.

"`29th.--The committee sat down again, and had a humbling, searching season;
and we were not able to see any way to move,
except to appoint the time for the monthly meeting to be held,
as it was adjourned on our account.
Before Friends separated to their several homes, we came together again;
and this was a contriting season, for which my soul rejoiced,
as we were likely to part in love.
In the evening received letters from home,
which conveyed sorrowful tidings of the removal, by the yellow fever,
of several relatives, neighbours and friends;
and that my own family had been visited with the sickness, yet so far,
were mercifully preserved in the land of the living;--my spirit was somewhat eased,
and the contents of my dear Sarah's letter were very sweet,
conveying an idea of the calmness and resignation in
which her mind was preserved under the trials allotted.
The Lord be magnified and bowed before, whether in suffering or rejoicing,
sickness or health, life or death; and O that my tried soul may still be favoured to say,
Your will, O Lord, and not mine be done.`"

On the 4th of the first month, 1796, after conferring together,
the committee concluded to move on.
They attended the monthly meeting at Coothill on the 7th,
composed of seven men and four women; where the queries were read and answered.
On the 8th they collected the few Friends together at Castleshane,
consisting of three women and three children.
On first-day, 10th, were at Grange meeting; and the next day at the preparative meeting.
On the 12th, to Cabarah, where a few families of Friends live in cabins;
in getting there they had to leave the carriage in the road,
"`and the women were conveyed behind the men on horseback,
some distance through the slush, to the cabin in which the meeting was held;
which was a dull, poor time,`" wherein he had nothing to communicate.

"`On the 13th, to the week-day meeting at Grange;
in which my mind was exercised to stand up with these expressions:
'Hell and destruction are open before the eyes of the Lord:
how much more the hearts of the children of men:' and that it was not my faith,
neither had I so learned Christ, as to believe that he does all without us;
but that when we have missed our way through disobedience,
we must know a fresh dispensation of repentance and amendment of life,
through the power of the Holy Spirit in the heart.
After dinner went over with John Abbott to T. G.'s, where we dropped into silence,
and these expressions arose for delivery;
'Without faithfulness we cannot find an interest in Christ;
and those who have vowed a vow unto the Lord, should pay it,
for the Lord has no pleasure in fools, etc.'
Pain and distress have been my condition, wherein I might say measurably,
that my God has humbled me among this people.

"`14th.--To Rich Hill monthly meeting.
The queries were read and answered while the women staid,
and I trust some solid and instructive remarks were made for their improvement.
The meeting held until dark,
and then adjourned to the close of one appointed to be held tomorrow.
After dinner sat with the overseers, both men and women,
and imparted such counsel as occurred, and after that, with the two men elders.

"`15th.--Went to an appointed meeting, which was large and mixed;
and I got through it to my humbling admiration.
There was a raw, inexperienced company assembled, some gay people,
and one Highland officer.
After which the monthly meeting concluded its business,
first appointing a few Friends to go from family to family,
and inspect into their condition,
particularly with regard to the testimony against war and fighting;
and to endeavour to persuade Friends to put away all
instruments of destruction and death out of their houses,
in this time of commotion amongst their neighbours;
it appears that several who had joined in those things, and were brought under dealing,
had condemned it.

"`16th.--To the monthly meeting at Moyallen, which was a time of enlargement to me,
wherein I was favoured to relieve my mind, both in the meeting for worship and business,
and things appeared hopeful.

"`17th.--A tossing night; and when I awoke, felt very poor and helpless; however,
I was favoured to put up a secret petition for protection and help before I arose.
Dear John Abbott came into my room to inquire which way I was going,
he inclining to go to Lurgan, and after breakfast I felt easy to go with him.
We got to our friend John Davis' about a half an hour before meeting time.
In this meeting; I was favoured with much enlargement, to my comfort and relief;
some brokenness appeared.
O how good it is to wait in patience, and depend upon that divine fountain that fails not.

"`19th.--To meeting at Antrim, which was small, and the house was damp,
having an earthen floor: about four men, some children, and seven women,
besides the committee, constituted the meeting, and it was a low time.

"`20th.--Set off pretty early, and rode nine miles to Grange meeting;
five men and four women made up the meeting when
it separated for the transaction of business;
the queries were read, and it was a very low time.
The gallery where we sat appeared tumbling down, and a damp earthen floor.
When the query respecting bearing arms and paying fines for war, etc., was read,
an old woman openly acknowledged, after her husband said he had not paid such a fine,
that she did; and made light of it, concluding it would not stand in her way.

"`21st.--Rode to Ballynacree, and on the 22nd held the preparative meeting.
This meeting-house joins a dwelling, and on sitting down,
it seemed like sitting in a cellar: two men, two women and three children composed it,
besides six of the committee.
My mind was exercised with the low state of things;
but was favoured soon to gain a state of quietude,
when the remembrance of these expressions was pleasant; 'The Lord lives,
that brings the seed of Abraham, or house of Israel, out of the north country,
and every country where they have been scattered;' and again, said the Prophet,
'The Lord will comfort Zion; he will comfort all her waste places,' etc.;
and my soul craved that this day might hasten.
After dinner rode to Colerain, to W. Gregg's; drank tea,
and then went to the meeting-house, and sat with him and his brother Dominick and wife,
who are all the members in this town: the queries were read and answered,
and my mind was not so oppressed as in some other places.

"`23rd.--The monthly meeting was held, consisting of seven men and three women;
and in the evening the committee sat down together to prepare a report.

"`24th, first-day.--To meeting; some few strangers came in,--I pitied them,
but had nothing for them: my condition as to ministry in this north part of Ireland,
seems as a book sealed; and I have been, and am favoured with contentment.

"`27th.--To Lurgan week-day meeting, and on the 28th to Moyallen;
after which went to my kind friend Mary Phelps'.`"

In a letter dated the 29th, from Mary Phelps', he says:

"`I am now waiting for John Abbott to join me in going towards the south;
we have been together ever since we left Dublin, in the beginning of the twelfth month,
and have gone through the north part of the island.
I have mourned under a sense of the darkness that prevails;
and when I have looked toward the people at large, feeling, I trust,
a willingness to preach the gospel among them,
I have remembered part of Elizabeth Webb's prospect concerning some,
when she had been querying whether the visitation of life and salvation was toward them;
the answer seems to be, that 'the buckets are frozen.'

"`There are parties raising up against each other in these parts,
and we hear of their going to houses in the night,
and murdering the dwellers in them--breaking their windows, and undermining their houses,
and ordering the inhabitants to leave the neighbourhood,
and sometimes in open battle against one another;
and the magistrates seem at a loss to know what to do;
but we have travelled without molestation, which is a favour.
I am not much, you know, concerned about informing of outward commotions,
and yet I thought so much occurred,
and things look very serious in this land,--
bringing to my mind Archbishop Usher's prophecy,
which if permitted to be fulfilled, will be dreadful indeed.
I have been favoured with some precious open meetings in some parts, as Dublin, etc.,
but truly here in the north, am like a sealed book; many silent ones; but through all,
have had to rejoice in that the great Master has a precious seed preserved,
and which I trust will be watered and made fruitful in due time.`"

Second month 2nd.--They arrived in Dublin, where they remained until the 7th,
when in company with his friend John Abbott,
he set off with a view of taking the meetings of the southern part of Ireland.
They attended the meeting at Wicklow on the 9th,
and in the evening got to one at Ballycane, on the 11th at Ballinsore,
on the 12th to Enniscorthy, and the 13th to Forrest meeting; "`in the fore part of which,
he says, the testimony was close to libertines,
yet was favoured with a portion of oil to the burden-bearers, especially the dear youth;
amongst whom, since leaving Dublin, my heart has been much enlarged,
and in some meetings considerable contrition appeared.
After this meeting, in which I laboured under the heavy weight of an increasing cold,
I rode home with Jacob Gough's wife and daughter, in a closed carriage,
and after dinner had a precious parting season offender love,
and I thought dear John Abbott had something precious to say.
He has been mostly silent since we left Dublin, Rode to Ross,
and put up with our friend John Cullymore,
who has been our kind companion and guide from Dublin.

"`14th, first-day.--Attended both morning and afternoon meeting,
in a weak state of body but was favoured with much enlargement of heart in both,
there appearing a visited little company, especially among the youth.

"`15th, second-day.--Rode ten miles to Waterford, and after tea, in the evening,
a large number of Friends came to see us,
and we were favoured together with the breaking of heavenly bread.

"`16th, third-day.--To meeting at Waterford, which was large, and an open time,
though weak in body.
After it to William Penrose's, who lives a little out of town,
and dined with several Friends; amongst the number was a youth under convincement,
not of our Society, who appears remarkably grave:
here I had another religious opportunity.

"`18th.--To Clonmel, and put up at the school; the meeting here was a close,
searching time--it being an adjournment of the monthly meeting.
I had afterwards some encouraging language to express in the men's meeting,
and then went into the women's. We dined at the school,
and had a sitting with the scholars, and then went to meet a committee,
and hope we were made useful to Friends.

"`19th.--I felt so unwell after dinner that I lay down, and was much refreshed.
Drank tea at Samuel Davis', after which, came Robert Dudley and wife, and several others;
and here we had a good time amongst them.
Mary Dudley appeared sweetly, and my companion also;
after which we had a tendering time with the scholars,
who waited for us with their governors, and several Friends that came to see us.

"`20th.--Went to Robert Dudley's and dined.
Sat down with this family, and had an open time amongst them.
Dear Mary poured out her supplications in the close for the children,
and that the Lord would be pleased to bless our
families with the same blessing hers was favoured with.

"`21st, first-day.--Felt very poor this morning when I arose,
and went to meeting in this state;
but had not sat long before a degree of light and life sprang up in my heart,
and was favoured to minister to a pretty large meeting.
The afternoon meeting was a large mixed one, and I had again an open time.
In the evening sat down with the children at the school, and a large number of Friends,
among whom were many youth;
when I requested some of the children might read
the 5th and 6th chapters of second Kings,
which two of them did, and it afforded me another full opportunity to discharge my mind.
John Abbott and Mary Dudley both appeared,--dear Sarah Grubb's remembrance was revived,
and I hope it was a baptizing season, to be remembered by many.`"

Extract from a letter dated Clonmel-school, second month 23rd, 1796, to George Dillwyn,
then in London.

"`Indeed I may say,
that my mind has been more at liberty since coming under this roof than for some time:
some precious and memorable seasons we have been favoured with,
both in this large family and with others in this town.
O how sweet has been the remembrance of dear Sarah Grubb; as unknown, and yet well known.
Things are sweet and savoury, and I trust her prayers have been heard,
and are and will be answered.

I have been frequently in company with dear Mary Dudley,
and esteem it a favour to be noticed and owned by such as she,
and other fellow servants in this land.
Very close were my trials in the north; and when returned to Dublin,
and looking towards these parts, it was trying to my exercised mind,
and I think I may be free to say to you, my brother, that I came forth weeping,
and it was good for me; for having been agreeably disappointed,
my heart has been humbled, and I find it good to trust in the Lord,
and not lean to my own understanding.
We had some precious meetings on the way from Dublin, as well as some trying ones.
There appears to be a number of youth under visitation, and when I meet with such,
either in meetings or families, it is like marrow to my bones As to myself,
I cannot let you into my secret with respect to returning, if happily favoured to do so:
if I saw the time near, perhaps I might be so free with one,
who several years ago gave me an instructive lesson, and which I have since,
pretty uniformly kept to, and found great profit in it; that was:
'When your mind is exercised with a prospect of going abroad,
do not deal it out by piecemeal,
but wait on the blessed Master until he ripen it in your mind,
and then spread it before your friends; and if there is life in it,
they will be sensible of it.'
Happier, I have thought, it would be for many amongst us,
if they knew how to keep their own, the king's, and the secrets of others, discreetly.

"`24th.--Got to Garryroan meeting in good time, which was a very close, exercising time.

"`26th.--Went to Limerick meeting in a low state, and sat so through the fore part of it,
but through favour was enabled to divide the word to various states present.

"`28th, first-day.--Attended the morning and afternoon meetings at Limerick,
and found much to do in both,
and I hope to some comfort and edification both of Friends and others,
and to the peace of my own mind.
In the evening, as I was sitting at our lodging with between thirty and forty Friends,
I felt sweetness cover my mind: my dear companion laboured amongst them in the fore part,
and I did not know but that I might be excused, but ventured to bow in supplication,
and afterwards was engaged in testimony.

"`29th.--Set off this morning, accompanied by Joseph Harvey and Jeremiah Morris.
Went to Charleville and dined; near this place, in which was once a meeting,
stood the house of the earl of Cork; of which John Exham, a valuable Friend,
prophesied the destruction; but for the kindness the earl showed to him,
he returned and told him the evil should not be in his day: all which was fulfilled,
and I do not find any trace of the house at this time.
In the last stage of our day's ride,
we passed through a part of what is called the Golden valley, or very rich land,
where stands the ruins of an old abbey.
In some of the ancient buildings in the town near it, called Killmallock,
is very curious hewn stone work,
and also the remains of a palace of one of the ancient kings.

"`Third month 1st,--Set off early, and got into Cork, to John Morris' before dinner;
felt stripped and exercised on coming to this place.

"`2nd.--Set off early this morning for Bandon meeting, in which I was shut up in silence;
and afterwards rode back to Cork.

"`3rd.--To meeting, and shut up.
4th.--In a stripped condition, and much so since coming into this place.

"`6th, first-day.--To Cork meeting, and sat some time in silence and poverty,
under an apprehension that too many were looking for words, and when I stood up,
was for some time without words to begin with; and yet, after a close, searching time,
I was favoured to get along in testimony, and relieve my mind pretty freely.
In the afternoon meeting I was again much exercised in testimony, and felt relieved.
After tea a considerable number called in,
and I was drawn forth in testimony amongst them, and took my leave,
the way opening for moving on in the morning.

"`8th.--To Youghall monthly meeting, where I sat pretty long in silence,
and was ready to conclude I should have finished so,
but near the close could not feel easy without saying some very close things.

"`9th.--After breakfast felt a liberty to call and sit with several Friends.
Spent the evening at George Peat's, in the house E. Richardson lived in, who,
though not in affluent circumstances,
entertained most of the travellers that came on truth's account to this place,
and the meeting used to be held in her parlour: several Friends came in,
and we had a solid opportunity.

"`10th.--To meeting, and it was a pretty comfortable time;
John Abbott appeared in prayer, and afterwards in testimony.

"`11th.--Set off early this morning for Waterford,
and stopped about eight miles on our way and refreshed.
While here I discovered that the iron axle-tree of our chaise was considerably cracked,
and we were detained some time to get it bound up.
At the last stage we found a man and a fresh horse,
sent by John Courtney to put to our chaise, and before nine o'clock at night,
we got into our old lodgings at this Friend's house in Waterford,
where we were kindly received.
Rode this day about fifty English miles.
The accommodations were so poor on the road, that we brought provisions with us.

"`13th, first-day.--This has been a laborious day to me,
being largely exercised in both morning and afternoon meeting,
and two sittings in the evening at our lodgings.

"`14th.--We drank tea at Mary Watson's, with several Friends,
and after it I had a full opportunity to speak to the states of several.

"`15th.--Went to meeting, where the labour fell on me, and it was a pretty open time.
Stopped in at William Penrose's, and hope it was a profitable tendering season;
after which we went to the widow Ussher's, who has three daughters,
and here we had a memorable time indeed.
Very soon after we sat down, tenderness and contrition appeared,
and I admired while speaking, to see such brokenness.
Dined at Joseph Hoyland's; after which several Friends stepped in,
and I had a religious opportunity, and another on our return to our lodgings.

"`16th.--Dear Mary Dudley and several others, came and breakfasted with us;
after which I had the servants called in and had a religious opportunity;
then went to the widow Ussher's, where I was comforted,
and took an affectionate leave of her and dear children;
she confessed with tenderness to the Lord's
goodness in sending his servants to visit them.
After dinner and bidding several families farewell, we rode to Ross.

"`17th.--Went to meeting at Ross, in a low condition,
where I found a considerable collection of other societies,
and amongst the rest Richard Rowe, who had been a priest, but had given up his living;
it proved a good time, and in the afternoon went to see this goodly man,
and was pleased with the visit; he appeared to receive us with gladness.

"`18th.--This morning we could not be easy without seeing another sober man,
who with two daughters, called upon us; and we had a tendering time;
the father and oldest child seemed much broken; the wife was unwell,
but after returning home he sent us word that she would see us,
and we went and had another tender time;
and came away from Ross pretty comfortable in mind.

"`19th.--Went to Killconnor meeting in a poor stripped state;
there was a number not of our Society at it--my companion appeared,
and after him I had a tendering time with some,
though there were others who were cause of grief and pain to my mind.
To this meeting John Cullimore came from his own home,
in order to accompany us to the quarterly meeting at Mount-mellick.

"`20th, first-day.--A night of conflict,
and was very poor and stripped this morning before I arose,
under some painful apprehension that I had not kept the
girdle of truth so close to my loins as I ought.
What a precious thing it is to be preserved tender--in this
state we are favoured soon to see the outgoing of the mind,
and feel a check even in the thoughts.
I went to meeting poor and humbled,
and to my admiration was strengthened to minister to the poor,
as well as to warn the unruly.
After dinner went seven miles to Athy meeting, at four o'clock.
I had no expectation of seeing so many of other societies, and was in a low state;
however, strength and courage were given me, and hope it was a time of profit.

"`22nd.--Found freedom to send and collect the few Friends together at Timahoe,
and on the 23rd, accompanied by W. and J. Pimm, attended the meeting;
there was but a small company, only two men who were members, and about seven women;
several neighbours came in, to whom both my companion and I had something to communicate,
and after they left us had a close time with such as were members.
One of the members, about a month ago,
was much wounded by a party of men coming to his house to demand arms.
We understand he made resistance,
and one of the balls fired at him lodged in his spectacle case in his pocket.
How happy for those, who in trying times can truly say, I am a Christian,
therefore I cannot fight.

"`24th.--To Rathangan meeting, where a number of strangers came in,
and I had to reason with those present, concerning temperance, righteousness,
and judgment to come, and hope the word was divided to the different states.
Drank tea at Jane Watson's, where was a number of Friends,
with whom I had a religious opportunity.

"`25th.--Set off for Mount-mellick, where we arrived before night and put up at J. G.'s,
Mary Ridgway's home.

"`27th, first-day.--A little better in health today,
and ventured out to meeting with muffling up; and very close things occurred to deliver.
In the afternoon meeting was silent,
but had two opportunities in the evening with some youth.

"`28th.--To meeting for business, and the adjournment at three o'clock,
wherein very close things escaped my lips,
and in the evening was not only much spent but humbled.

"`29th.--To another adjournment at ten o'clock, wherein my mind was lifted up a little,
and I thought the precious testimonies of truth
appeared to be growing in importance in Friends' minds.
At five o'clock went to what is called the parting meeting; in which I was silent.

"`30th.--To the week-day meeting, and was silent.
In the afternoon the select meeting met, the fore part of which was a dull time,
but it ended comfortably, and a minute was made in acknowledgment of the favour;
my heart was in some degree enlarged: went through the schools,
and came home in the evening under a load of exercise,
and in a religious opportunity bowed in supplication; and there appeared a cause,
not only on my own account, but that of others.

"`Fourth month 3rd, first-day.--Although much unwell this day,
yet was favoured to relieve my mind amongst Friends in the morning meeting,
and appointed one for the town, to be held at five o'clock in the evening:
it was very large, so that the house could not hold the people,
and I trust it was favoured.
The people were solid and still, and remained so after going out.
A number of gay people came and took me by the hand at the close,
and appeared thankful for the opportunity.

"`4th.--Went on towards Birr; stopped at a poor inn by the way,
and refreshed ourselves with some provisions which Friends gave us;
and afterwards had a religious opportunity with the inn-keeper, his wife and family,
to our satisfaction.

"`5th.--To the meeting at Birr, where many strangers came in,
with whom I had a pretty good time.

"`6th.--In the meeting at Roscrea, I was silently shut up;
and in an evening meeting at Knockballymaher, great dullness appeared,
and nothing for me to do.

"`7th.--To the meeting at Mountrath, which was large and mixed;
I was favoured soon to feel that there were some precious plants there,
among whom I had a good time.
John Abbott also had a share in the labour,
and I ventured to conclude the meeting by prayer.

"`8th.--To Ballinakill meeting, which was a time of suffering;
there was a poor little company of Friends, and some few others stepped in;
after some considerable time of silent exercise,
I ventured to prostrate myself and supplicate the Lord to remember poor desolate Zion, etc.
Before the meeting concluded, several others with some soldiers coming in,
I felt for and addressed them.
After dinner, accompanied by several Friends, rode to Kilkenny.

"`9th.--Arrived at Anner-mills, twenty-two miles.
I feel much recruited in my bodily powers,
and believe I should have felt pleasanter if I had been more watchful last evening.
O what a poor weak and feeble creature I am,
when the divine arm is but a little withdrawn to prove me;
and what state is more safe than a broken contrite one--learn contentment therein,
O my soul.

"`10th, first-day.--Rode to meeting with Sarah Grubb and her sister, E. Pimm,
and was favoured with a relieving time;
and in the afternoon meeting had an opportunity to open the
principles of truth to a number of soldiers and others who came in,
and behaved solidly; then back to Sarah Grubb's,
and in the evening the family was called in,
when a portion of the Holy Scriptures was read by the children--a commendable practice.

"`15th.--Surely it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs,
but of God that shows mercy.
O how gloomy have prospects been of late to my mind! what a poor,
and if it may not be too nearly reflecting on divine Goodness,
what a wretched man I have often felt myself I have cause to be thankful in feeling so,
that afterward the riches of divine love and mercy may be more magnified.
May I then wait and watch in patience; for when the Sun of righteousness shines forth,
these clouds disappear: sorrow continues for a night, but joy comes in the morning;
and I am thankful to find a liberty to think and hope so much as this.`"

In a letter written from this place, fourth month 15th, to his father-in-law,
David Bacon, he says:

"`We have been pretty busily employed since I wrote you my last,
and I think there is but one meeting of Friends in this nation but what I have been at,
and some of them several times over.
I have had deeply to feel of late,
the force and truth of the dear Master's language to his disciples;
'After you have done all that I have commanded you,
say we are unprofitable servants,' etc., feeling myself often a very poor creature;
sometimes I think, like a vessel that has been beating about in the sea,
and needs refitting.
Well, if I can but be so preserved as to retain my faith in his holy Name,
and to believe that he will yet preserve the little bark,
and trust it again on the waters to the peace of my poor tribulated soul in the end,
and to the praise of his ever excellent name, to whom belongs the praise of his own work,
both in time and eternity,--it is all I desire.
Through holy help I have been favoured to behold
some fruits of fervent labour in this land;
yes, I trust I have seen at seasons,
that the labours of the servants who have of
late been sent into this land have been blessed.
I went to see a widow of considerable note in Waterford, who,
with three lovely daughters have attended Friends' meetings for some months past,
and paid them two tendering visits.
I have met with nothing in all my travels,
more like what we read of in the beginning of our forefathers' labours,
than our first visit to this tender family,--though in gay life,
yet to behold the brokenness, even before words were uttered, was to my admiration.

The last time we were at Ross, there came in several goodly people,
to whom I felt the love of the gospel flow,
and after the meeting we visited two of them in their families.
The first was a young clergyman,
who has been so brought under a right exercise and concern,
that sometime back he called his flock together and took leave of them;
informing them that he had not a right commission to preach.
He has given up his living also, and entered into the corn business,
in partnership with a neighbour; he appears under much exercise of mind,
and I thought it was evident he received us with gladness.
The other is a merchant, who, I was informed, had been brought up to the law:
in the opportunity with him he was much broken,
and it was also remarked that one of the children particularly, was much tendered.
O, says my soul, and all that is living within me,
that the great Lord of the harvest would hasten the day,
when more precious fruits may appear in the earth:
that more sons and daughters may come under this description mentioned by the prophet;
'It shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come,
and see my glory.
And I will set a sign among them,
and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud,
that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off,
that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;
and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.'

"`18th.--Went to quarterly meeting, and had to labour among the men in a close manner;
afterwards went into the women's meeting, and had an open time.

"`19th.--Still close and exercising times in the adjournment:
the meeting ended this evening.
When the subject respecting bearing arms was brought before the meeting,
a precious covering was over it; gainsaying spirits were silenced,
and a minute was made to stir up overseers to visit
such as have destructive weapons in their habitations,
and induce them to destroy them;
and Friends are about establishing another boarding school:'
on the whole it gave me joy and comfort to see that truth and
righteousness are thriving over all opposition in Ireland.

"`20th.--Attended the parting meeting; and though a close and searching time,
I hope it was profitable; dear M. Dudley summed up the exercises in the close,
to my comfort.
After sitting with the select members in the adjournment of that meeting,
which was a season to be remembered, and may my soul be humbled,
Mary took me to Anner-mills in her carriage;
and it was a time wherein we poor exercised labourers
were brought into great nearness and fellowship.`"

After this he proceeded through Kilkenny and Ballitore, and on the 22nd arrived in Dublin.

"`24th, first-day.--I am a poor unworthy creature,
and if again favoured to stand forth in the noble cause of truth and righteousness,
surely it must be of the Lord's mercy.
I am looking: and feeling,
in order to ascertain whether way will open after this national meeting,
to return to England.
Sometimes the query arises in my heart,
shall I be favoured to see my dear aged mother in this world?
If not, O that we may be favoured, through adorable mercy, to meet in the world to come,
in happiness and peace.
Went to Sycamore alley meeting; and though it was small,
I was favoured with an open time,
and in the close desired Friends to invite their neighbours to the afternoon meeting;
when we had a large gathering, and though a laborious time,
with some dark spirits to deal with, yet hope it was a time of profit,
tending to exalt the name of Christ Jesus my Lord and Saviour.
In the evening felt easy and quiet in mind,
and as comfortable in body as I could wish for.

"`25th, second-day.--To the men's national meeting for business, held in Meath street,
both morning and afternoon, in which I was much engaged,
and felt a fear lest I dealt rather closely with
some who appeared to move in too shallow water.
Consider, O my soul, that you are liable to temptation!

Fifth month 1st.--Meeting for business ended late on fifth-day evening,
and sixth-day was the parting meeting,
and the meeting for ministers and elders,--and my mind
has been so taken up with the service of them,
etc., that I have made no memorandums.
Let it suffice that I have been favoured to travel through; and today, first-day,
attended very large meetings, and much labour has fallen to my share,
and sweet enriching peace is my portion this evening,
which is better than anything this world can afford.

"`3rd.--To meeting, which was very large, and I had an open time to my great admiration,
considering what an unworthy,
poor creature I felt like when I arose from my bed and went to the meeting;
several Friends stopped in after meeting, and I had another opportunity.`"

On the 4th he embarked for Liverpool, in company with twenty-five Friends,
where they arrived on the 7th. On the 8th, first-day,
he attended both meetings at Liverpool, and was "`shut up in silent poverty.`"
On the 12th he reached London,
and was kindly received by his friends Joseph and Rachel Smith,
where David Sands also arrived in the evening, and took up his lodgings.

"`15th, first-day,--I went to Grace-church street meeting, and had an open,
relieving time; dined at George Stacey's with David Sands,
who attended Devonshire house meeting, and we went to Westminster together.`"

The yearly meeting of London coming on,
and his mind being brought under deep exercise and discouragement,
no memorandums occur until the following:

I laid aside my pen until this morning, the 6th of sixth month, and second of the week;
feeling more cheerful and comfortable in mind.
I have passed through a scene of affliction of late,
not only during the time of the yearly meeting, but since;
my religious prospect appearing at times almost like a brook dried up.`"

The following extracts are taken from a letter which he received while in London,
from his beloved friend Rebecca Jones:

"`Sitting pensively and alone this evening,
while Friends are assembled at the High street meeting-house,
and recounting some of the Lord's gracious
dealings and marvellous acts towards and upon me,
you were brought so preciously near to my disconsolate mind,
that I have taken the pen in hand to tell you so.

Your letter to me, written partly at sea,
and your remembrance of me in those to your dear wife and son,
both revived and contrited my spirit.
Our dear brother Samuel Emlen was at our North meeting this morning,
where he was enabled to declare the Master's counsel faithfully in a living testimony,
which, with a similar one from dear Deborah Darby two weeks ago,
was like 'summing up the evidences' for me,
now near the close of the arduous family visit I have been engaged in,
and which I trust will be completed in another week.
I have proceeded gradually, often beset with discouragements,
often in great weakness and fear.
But the Lord who healed me in sickness, has been near,
and to Him be the praise of his own works;
for indeed his hand alone has opened a door of admission into the houses of my friends,
and melted many of our hearts together,
under the softening influences of his great mercy and loving kindness toward us.
May I be kept little and low before him,
and may you derive some encouragement from this feeble testimony to his goodness;
so as to finish the work which may be given you
to do in that part of the Lord's vineyard,
where he has many precious plants, unto whom my spirit is united in Christian fellowship.

Our yearly meeting was large and solemn, and some steps have been taken, I hope,
in best wisdom, for the advancement of the great and good cause:
a joint committee of men and women Friends was appointed to consider
and arrange matters for opening a boarding school for the youth;
so that in time we may have an American Ackworth, which was dear Sarah Grubb's prospect.
I am too old to enter again into the service,
but as my heart wishes prosperity to the work,
I have submitted to have my name on that committee.

When the afflicting tidings of dear Elizabeth Drinker's departure arrived,
I went down and staid a great part of the day with dear Daniel and Abigail,
where I had to tell them that our sitting solemnly together reminded
me of the time when Job's friends sat with him in silent astonishment,
and that it was sealed upon my spirit, with regard to the dear departed,
that all is well.
Soon after this your letter to Daniel came to hand, and I read it to the relations,
wherein were the very same expressions,
which you offered as descriptive of your first visit to her.
They bear the affliction as becomes Christian minds, and will, I hope,
be supported under the close trial,
by the same good hand which was so eminently near her to the end.

After alluding to several recent deaths she says:

It is indeed a solemn day every where:
O that the inhabitants of the earth may now learn righteousness.
May the work you are engaged in be blessed by the great Master;
for as the ability is from him,
so must we also leave the issue with Him who can work without us, and also with us,
as he pleases.
May your heart endure and your hands be strong in our Master's service,
that so his blessed will may be perfected, and your peace flow as a river.
Think sometimes of poor me, and intercede when you can for my preservation; for O,
I feel as though I should sink like poor Peter did, was the divine hand withdrawn;
and my faith, like his, is often very small.

You are frequently in my affectionate remembrance,--may the Shepherd of Israel,
who evidently put you forth, go before you and make all your labour prosperous,
under his immediate blessing; without which, neither the planting of Paul,
nor the watering of Apollos, will promote the intended happy increase of righteousness,
which is in the Lord's time to cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea.
May infinite Wisdom be pleased, for his own name's sake, to hasten this day;
and may we wait in patience, and endure hardness as good soldiers, for Christ's sake,
seeing that to him and his followers the victory is decreed.

Went to morning meeting in a humbled condition, and soon prostrated myself on my knees,
and prayed to the Father and fountain of mercies, for myself, and my fellow labourers,
both on sea and land, our wives, children, etc.,
and for all the Lord's gathered messengers.
Spent part of the afternoon retired alone in my chamber, under close conflict; and yet,
after so often mentioning these things,
I know there is no room for murmuring or repining.
Cast your care then, O my tribulated soul, on the Lord,
and patiently wait until deliverance comes.
What greater trial is there than to be stripped and unclothed of all good,
and to sit in this state from day to day, and appear like an idler in the work,
so far from home; these are peculiar trials.

"`12th, first-day.--Attended the meeting at Tottenham,
in which Sarah Harrison had a remarkably close time;
soon after I took my seat in the afternoon meeting,
I felt a little to communicate in weakness to some of the servants,
and those of low degree, etc., in an encouraging line.
Sarah Harrison had such a searching time,
that it seemed as though my foundation was brought to the test,
and I thought she was rightly led, whether I was or not.
Ah, me! what a poor soldier am I, if indeed I am one at all.
I have put on a cheerful countenance, and in some instances of late,
when in company with my valued brother, David Sands,
I have been roused and cheered a little; but still my heart has been sad.

"`14th.--Felt a little ray of light and sweetness on awaking this morning.
After breakfast looked over this book of my journeys, travels and conflicts,
to this time; and truly I think I am a poorer creature than heretofore.
O that I may be accounted worthy of the name of a servant of Christ.
Surely my state now resembles that of one laid aside; but dare I complain,
even if it should be the blessed Master's will to lay me aside!

"`15th.--Went to town with Thomas Horne and wife, and to Grace-church street meeting,
where I found David Sands, and it was a solid, silent time:
the adjournment of the monthly meeting was held at the close,
when a certificate was read and signed for George Dillwyn to visit Germany,
his wife being included in it.

"`19th,
first-day.--This morning Joseph Smith and David Sands stopped
with a postchaise and took me to Hartford meeting;
in which dear David was preciously enlarged, especially in the afternoon,
in a meeting appointed for the people of the town.

"`20th.--To the quarterly meeting,
which I hope was throughout a good time of encouragement.
David Sands and I visited the women's meeting.

"`21st.--David Sands and companion inclining to go to London,
to be at Devonshire house meeting,
and dear Sarah Harrison appearing under a close exercise to go to Brentford meeting,
I felt at liberty to accompany her: and though I had nothing to communicate,
yet was willing to bear up her hands, and got back to Tottenham in good season.
Felt my mind, this evening, drawn much inward, under close exercise,
and was shut up from conversation; and when we sat down to supper,
was favoured to prostrate in humble supplication.
It was a time of baptism, I trust to be remembered.
After which I lay down more sweet and comfortable than for a long time.
O what a favour once more vouchsafed to poor unworthy me.

"`22nd.--A sweet refreshing night, and comfort extended when awake.
Awake then, O my soul, and listen to the voice of your beloved, who has not cast you off;
look forward with humble, depending patience, and hope in his mercy.

"`24th.--Attended the scholars' meeting at Clerkenwell;
there were not many men Friends there;
but to me it was an open comfortable time with the children:
afterwards I stepped over amongst the poor women in the Alms house,
and had a tendering time.
In the evening went to an appointed meeting for Sarah Harrison,
held in a barn about two miles from Tottenham; it was large, and I hope to profit.

"`25th.--At Tottenham meeting, both morning and afternoon, which were favoured seasons;
David Sands and I returned to Thomas Horne's together,
and after supper he was much opened in conversing on some passages of Scripture,
to our edification and comfort; and in the close a sweet covering of good,
more and more spread, and I kneeled down in supplication;
dear Sarah followed in the same line, and it was indeed a memorable evening.

"`27th.--To London quarterly select meeting; and in it I felt unwell and much exercised.

"`28th.--To the quarterly meeting for business,
and hope I was favoured rightly to bend in supplication;
and this was all that fell to my share, either in the public meeting,
or in the business part.`"

From the 29th of sixth to 10th of seventh month,
was mostly spent in visiting the meetings in the vicinity of London,
particularly Tottenham; and also a considerable number of families,
in which he was favoured with ability to open the states of individuals,
and administer proper religious counsel;
describing them as being frequently heart-melting, humbling or tendering seasons.

From London he addressed a letter to his friend Rebecca Jones, dated seventh month, 1796,
from which the following is extracted.

Thomas Scattergood to Rebecca Jones

My very dear friend,

Your letter, which came safely to hand,
is a fresh proof of your sisterly sympathy and love, and has done me much good.
It was pleasant to find that you had been to New York and Rahway,
the latter a place both of exercise and of favour to me in days past.
From what I have lately heard, I do not marvel that your sorrow has been great,
and the language of my soul at this moment is, not only on your account, but also my own,
'Lord, bring me out of my distresses,
and preserve through all that you in your wisdom may permit to come upon us.'
And, my dear friend, my faith is renewed on your account,
that your feet will not be moved from the sure foundation; and after saying so much,
it is in my heart to add, remember poor me.

Very pleasant to me was your account of the young preachers.
I rejoice in their growth; remembering, and humblingly so,
how mercifully I was cared for in the day when, like a little child, I tottered along,
and sometimes slipped, and fell and bruised myself thereby;
yet help was reached forth both immediately and instrumentally.
When we remember those seasons, who can grudge or deal hardly with any of the little ones.
I was glad to hear so good an account of dear J. W.,
he was near to my best life before I left you,
and I thought what has happened would come to pass, and told him so.
May the great Master of the family and Shepherd of the sheep,
preserve all on the right foundation,
and enable them to spread his name abroad in due time.

O what stripping has there been amongst you, since I saw your faces!
I have had many humbling thoughts in looking at these things,
but have consoled myself in the persuasion,
that the God of the whole earth doubtless does right.
I request you to call and, as ability is afforded,
yield the sympathy of your spirit to my dear wife and aged mother;
and when you have a little of heavenly good,
do not withhold it from your poor and often tried friend,
who needs your sympathy and prayers for his support, and probably may yet more need them.

Seventh month 10th,
first-day.--Having heard that Wahham Abbey meeting was to be opened this day,
for the few living in that neighbourhood and Epping,
I felt a freedom to go and sit with them, and was accompanied by Thomas Horne,
wife and daughter S. Soon after I sat down amongst the little company,
some encouragement spread over my mind,
and after a time I arose on my feet and endeavoured to express it;
and before I had done a number of persons of other societies came in,
and I hope on the whole it ended well.

We stopped at John Burgess', and after some time spent in conversation,
my heart was filled up,
and broken under a sense of the Lord's mercies to me from my youth,
in leading me about and instructing me to that moment,
I had an opportunity to express some of the feelings of my mind;
and it opened an effectual door for my exercised friend to relieve her mind,
in which I rejoiced.
Returned back with sweetness of mind,
and had another opportunity at Thomas Horne's with a number of youth;
here I learned that William Savery had arrived in London.

"`11th.--Set off rather earlier in order to see dear William before meeting,
but found he had gone.
How were my feelings awakened in several respects,
on dear William's certificate being read,
and the prospect of his accompanying David Sands and George Dillwyn into a strange land;
mine in that respect closed up.
I desire to wait on Him who has, in abundant mercy, made hard things easy,
and bitter things sweet.
The sorrows of my heart have of late been great, and yet not without a mixture of joy,
for which I bow, I hope with reverence and awe, knowing I cannot add anything,
neither diminish.
Surely it is of the Lord's goodness I am not confounded.
Attended the school meeting at Clerkenwell, and an examination of the scholars.
William and David had good opportunities with the children.

"`15th.--Went on board the ship William Penn with Nicholas Wain, my father David Bacon,
Sarah Harrison, George Dillwyn and wife, David Sands, William Savery, and others.
Nicholas Wain appeared easy to take his passage.
After dinner retired for the purpose of writing.`"

In a letter to his son, dated the 16th,
in alluding to the circumstance of a house in the vicinity of his own,
being struck with lightning, he says:

I notice with renewed thankfulness, your preservation 'from the arrow that flies by day.'
We have been kept in a season when terror was in the night;
and when the pestilence walked in darkness, and destruction wasted at noonday.
Many have fallen at our right hand and at our side,
and only with our eyes have we so far beheld his marvellous work.
O may you all keep this so great mercy in view,
not knowing how soon it may be the pleasure of
Omnipotence again to visit with these things.
And if both I and you, of my dear family, are concerned to make the Lord our refuge,
even the Most High our habitation, he will then, doubtless,
condescend to keep us in all our ways, and direct our steps aright;
and whether sooner or later, make all our bed in sickness.
This is what often occupies my mind; for indeed,
to be favoured in time to be the servant of the Lord, doing his will, and not our own,
and to seek earnestly after a habitation with the just,
is worth living and suffering for, according to his will, often bearing in remembrance,
that here we have no continuing city.

I am comforted in the persuasion, that you wilt not lose sight of these important things;
and if so happily favoured,
then I know that the Lord will bless you and give you enough of the earth,
for the cattle of a thousand hills are his, and he gives and dispenses at his pleasure.
Therefore, seek first the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof,
and all things necessary will be added.

"`17th, first-day.--This morning I felt most easy to go to Ratcliff meeting:
my father-in-law, David Bacon, and Joseph Smith accompanied me;
and we were favoured with an open good time;
and in the close requested Friends would take
pains and invite their neighbours to the meeting,
my dear friend and brother David Sands, intending to sit with them.
To the meeting at six o'clock, where I had some little to communicate,
and David a large time, and I hope it was to profit.

18th, second-day.--To morning meeting,
and at six o'clock to a large meeting held in a barn near Blackwall,
appointed by Sarah Harrison, which was a satisfactory time.

"`19th.--To Devonshire house meeting, where I found William Savery, who was silent.
I had a good time, also dear George Dillwyn.
William appointed a meeting at six o'clock, for the inhabitants.
Went home and dined, and after a heart humbling season,
wherein both David Sands and Sarah Harrison appeared in
prayer for the preservation of the poor labourers,
etc., and taking an affectionate farewell, my father David Bacon,
accompanied me to Thomas Horne's; soon after which,
came in Thomas Phillips and several others, with whom, and this family,
I had a tendering time, and after it spent the evening sweetly.`"

The following extract is taken from a letter addressed
to him by his beloved friend Mary Dudley,
dated:

Ross, Seventh month 2nd, 1796.

Beloved friend,

When I was in this place some weeks ago,
the stream of precious fellowship run so strongly in inclination to salute you,
that I have often since regretted that I did not yield to it;
not that I then knew I had anything good in possession,
nor am I now sensible of any qualification, but the renewing of the same feeling,
and the continuance of that love,
which I trust will never be quenched by any of the waters of trial or waves of conflict,
with which the poor vessel may yet be tossed in
its probationary passage to the land of rest.
Surely, if ever I am favoured to enter the harbour, it will be through abundant mercy;
for at seasons, so many are the fears attendant on the path allotted me,
that the grain of faith seems too small to keep
in steady hope of everlastingly anchoring there:
nevertheless, when favoured to get into the region of calm resignation,
faith strengthens and hope revives;
and knowing that the Lord sits above the water floods, and remains King forever,
the burden is, I trust, acceptably cast on him, and a consoling persuasion experienced,
that he continues to care for me.
These are things mostly worn within, but to you, my dear brother,
it is no marvel if the heart should get a little vent,
seeing how wondrously your mind has been dipped in relation to a subject, wherein,
like the roll written within and without,
my meditations are employed oftener than the returning day,
though I thought not of touching upon it just now.

It was a sort of sad communication which my spirit seemed holding with yours,
and the uniting feeling inclined me thus to tell you so;
believing yours is truly a path of deep exercising travail,
wherein perhaps the tracks of many footsteps are not seen--a
line wherein you are made to resemble your great Master,
who 'was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.'
Well, this you know is the acceptable way to 'fill up that which is
behind of the afflictions of Christ for the body's sake,
which is the church.'
And O, says my soul,
that great was the addition to the church militant of
such members as were resigned to these dispensations,
and willing to be plunged deep enough to complete this measure of inward suffering.
But do not fear, I speak freely what I have said in my heart often,
that there is much of a dwelling on the surface, not only in people, but in the ministry?
Are the different states visited by all thus concerned,
as their various exigencies require?
The ground of true ministry appears increasingly awful to my view,
and 'Who is sufficient for the work,`" is the frequent inquiry raised;
and who can be fitted,
but such as are willing to drink of the cup and bear the repeated
baptisms '.' These bear about in the body the marks of the Lord Jesus,
and these availingly visit the sick and imprisoned seed, even in silent travail,
when deep only utters unto deep.
Well, my endeared friend, great is the liberty of the truth,
and much the freedom with which I address you, as though conversing, or,
as dear Esther Tuke used to say, 'thinking aloud.'

"`20th.--Set off this morning about eight o'clock, with my dear father,
who has given up to accompany me a little on my journey, and several other Friends;
put up at Benjamin Finsham's, and attended the meeting of Friends.
Appointed one for the town's people at six o'clock.
Went to James Haley's, where came his brother and sister Coxhead,
with whom I had a religious opportunity, and it appeared to be well received.
He is called sir John, and is a member of Parliament; she, a plain woman.

"`21st.--This morning we stepped into most of the families of Friends.
Dined at Thomas Coxhead's, with his wife and several others, he being gone to London;
and after it my spirit was broken and humbled so much as to bring me on my knees.
I remembered a circumstance which occurred,
when I sat out with David Brooks for New England;
we had stopped at a house several days' journey from home,
and taking up an old Testament, I attempted to read;
but my spirit was swallowed up with such a weight and solemnity, and,
as I then apprehended,
the spirit of supplication was poured out on me as I had never felt it before,
that I could not read; and laying down my book, sat in an awful state of mind,
until called to dinner, and then gave way to my exercise; and after it my elder brother,
David Brooks, continued the same.
Ah! surely it was a moment not to be forgotten by me, in my then infant state.
And how earnestly did my soul crave preservation in this season now vouchsafed,
both for myself and for others in an infant state.

"`22nd.--To Benjamin Finsham's. Here we obtained
liberty to go and set in the chamber of a sick daughter,
where we had father and mother, son and daughter together,
and my friend Susanna Horne was favoured fully to relieve her mind, for which I rejoiced;
and taking an affectionate leave,
my father and I mounted our horses and pursued our journey.
Stopped on our way about four miles, and visited a widow and daughter-in-law, which,
I hope was a time of encouragement.
Got to Bishop Stortford about two o'clock,
and soon after gave liberty to invite their neighbours,
to come together at meeting at six o'clock.
I admire at the kindness shown me of latter days.
My burden has been lightened and I moved on cheerfully this day,
accompanied by my dear father.
The appointed meeting was large, and to me a laborious one, but was favoured,
after a considerable time of silence, to begin in great weakness, and got through.
When I was coming out, I met with a large number of poor,
shabby looking youth on the stairs, who stopped, and some also were near the door,
and I had to encourage them to be good children, that so they might be made great;
having had in the course of my testimony to address such,
and told them that God was able to raise up from the stones of the street,
children unto Abraham.

"`24th.--To meeting at Saffron Walden,
and was favoured with an open precious time of encouragement,
and at the close appointed one for the town,
which was a season of much enlargement in testimony with me,
and I had a sweet refreshing time.
After getting home and sitting quiet, a humble hope revived,
that the Lord my heavenly Master would not leave me,
though he may see fit yet to prove and try my faith, patience and love.

"`26th.--To the monthly meeting, which was larger than usual,
and attended by several youth from a distance;
in the fore part of it my soul was humbled and prostrated in prayer for myself,
fellow-labourers in this land and others, with those left behind at home;
and afterwards I had a pretty large time in testimony.
The business was sweetly conducted in brotherly love;
we dined at George Gibson's with a number of Friends, after which came in several more,
and amongst them I had a full good time, tendering the minds of several of the youth;
soon after which had to part from my dear father David Bacon,
he setting off with William Grover and wife, with a view of returning to London,
and I am left behind without a companion; but not like a partridge on the mountain,
or a sparrow on the house top, because sustaining help has been near,
and still remains to be so at this moment.
Thanks be rendered where they are due:
and O may my poor soul trust in the Lord throughout the present journey,
and to the end of my pilgrimage in this land, come whatever may be permitted to come,
to try me.

"`27th.--Arose in a poor and stripped state, and went to the week-day meeting,
where I was soon favoured with such a sweet silence,
and in it had to look towards my dear wife,
with faith to believe that the Almighty arm is near to sweeten her mind,
and protect those I have left behind, in life or in death,
that I could have sat contentedly through the meeting in silence.
But after a season I was favoured to minister a word of encouragement to my friends;
and surely there is need of humble thankfulness
for the favours I have experienced of late,
and since coming to this place.`"

On the 28th he was at Stansted; 29th at Thaxted; 30th at Dunmow; and the 31st, first-day,
at the meeting at Chelmsford, in which he says,
"`Elizabeth and George Gibson had a little to communicate,
and I thought in the fore part something would have fallen to my share,
but all was dried up, and I sat the meeting through in silence.
In the afternoon my mind was drawn to look toward my dear wife and family,
far separated in body from me.
How has my spirit been present with them,
accompanied with prayers and supplications to the Father of mercies on their account,
and with sweetness and assurance that the Preserver of men is near and will be so:
this has often been the case, and yet when thoughts deeply impress my soul,
that if it should be ordered in the counsel of our God,
that my dear companion and I meet not again in this world,
surely I have believed that we shall in the world to come,
where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage,
as says our blessed Redeemer and Saviour;
and where such as finish their course with joy in this world,
are to be as the angels in heaven.
Even so be it, O God, with humble submission says my soul,
whether such a baptism be to try my faith and love and the stroke be deferred,
or whether I may be as a sign to the people in this land, as the prophet was in his day.
O my God, favour me as much as is profitable for your servant,
to put sorrow away from my heart,
that both with flesh and heart I may seek your face continually,
and be favoured to do and suffer your blessed will,
which will be my sanctification--Amen.`"

While here he addressed the following letter to Sarah Cresson,
who had been but a short time in the station of a minister:

Robert Marriage's, near Chelmsford, Essex, Eighth month 1st, 1796.

Dear Cousin,

Having left most of my letters in my trunk in London, and yours amongst them,
I have it not with me; but thinking much of you this morning,
which I may tell you I have done at other times, with near and tender affection,
I concluded to take up my pen and tell you so.

Many and various are the trials which such poor things as I am,
separated from near and dear connections, have to pass through;
and they have a tendency to dip the mind into a feeling sympathy with
and for those who have set out in the same blessed work.
The desire of my soul is, that you,
with all those who are called of our heavenly Father to labour in his vineyard,
may keep steady to the work; for blessed are they who keep their hands to the plough,
looking and pressing forwards, under the direction of their Holy Head and High priest.
These will meet with sufficient encouragement by the way:--remember then, dear child,
the way to profit is to give yourself wholly to the work,
so will your profiting appear to all;
study to show yourself approved unto the Lord your God,
a workwoman in his house and family that need not be
ashamed,--rightly dividing the word of Truth,
unto which service you are beyond any doubt in my mind called.
Let not little acts of faith and love, in the gospel of him,
who has called you and sanctified you for his work, pass by undone;
for a cheerful surrender of your will and faculties in little acts of obedience,
will make way for more, so wilt you know your day's work keeping pace with the day,
and then you may look forward to the end, which crowns all,
even a finishing of your work and course with joy, and receive that crown,
which is laid up in store for all such as love the Lord Jesus Christ, and do his will.
Love retirement and reading the Holy Scriptures.
Treasure up such parts of them as forcibly strike your mind,
and then at seasons you wilt witness the key of David handed to you,
which will unlock your little treasury, and open the mysteries with more enlargement,
for the help and benefit of others, who are ignorant and unlearned.
Here is the use and end of a gospel ministry, which is not received of man, but of God;
and that which is received in secret, quiet retirement, revives in meetings and families,
and commandment is given to proclaim it abroad.

Therefore, as a beloved younger sister in the work,
I charge and counsel you to give yourself to reading, meditation and prayer,
and may your God and mine give you wisdom in all things,
to go in and out before the people.
Let no one despise your youth; neither let in discouragement from this quarter;
but in humility and reverence, seek for a qualification to say, Here am I Lord,
first prepare and then send me.

I have now, while writing, the pleasant company of my valuable friend and mother,
Elizabeth Gibson: she and her husband have both been with me nearly a week.
He has gone to a monthly meeting about eighteen miles off,
and has left me at his son-in-law's to rest,--
and if they do not both go on with me tomorrow,
I expect dear George will, and for all I see, go with me through this county.
He is indeed, in my opinion, a choice spirited Friend,
and a comfortable couple they both appear to be, much beloved by their friends.
Two nieces of his live with them,
who have been as affectionate to me while at their house,
as I could look for my own children to be;
and very comfortable I felt under their uncle's roof I thought
this account would be pleasing to your dear mother,
to whom present my continued love and sympathy; and tell her,
that it was good house-keeping formerly, when the prophet kept the widow's house;
and my desire is, that the great Prophet of prophets,
may yet have room in her house and heart.
My dear love to your brother Ebenezer,--tell him,
though I have not felt qualified to answer his affectionate letter,
yet he may be assured that he has a place in the mind of his absent relation,
who has rejoiced in hearing that he was dear J. W.'s armour bearer.
And O that he and my dear son,
may be companions in the way that leads to the everlasting kingdom.

My love to all the rest of the precious lesser plants in the family.
O that they may grow up as plants in their youth,
and know a being dignified by the Truth in their day.
May you and your dear mother be encouraged to continue labour towards them,
to bend the tender twigs and form the mind.
Ah! how my heart yearns towards mine own likewise, for whom my prayers are put up,
that they may be the Lord's children.
In near and tender love I salute you once more,
who am your affectionate friend and relation,

Thomas Scattergood.

"`Eighth month 2nd.--After attending the meeting at Maiden,
which I trust was a profitable one, rode to the widow Hurnard's.

"`3rd.--A solid opportunity with this family, including the servant maid,
who was very much tendered, even to weeping aloud.
Went to meeting at Witham, where I understood was a Roman priest,
one of the emigrants from France, a curate, and various persons of note,
amongst them a physician, who had been much prejudiced against Friends;
he stood most of the time, and appeared considerably tendered.
A Friend meeting him afterward, he was broken, and sent his love and good wishes to me,
and appeared much satisfied in being at meeting.
The Lord be praised for the manifestations of his goodness to my soul,
both in the meeting and since, by shining through the cloud.
Were it not for a draught of living water from the brook by the way,
what would become of such a poor lonely creature!

"`4th.--To the meeting at Kelvedon, which was large, and an open favoured time;
the people behaved well.
The people in the streets, as we passed along,
were very respectful and kind in noticing me, and I fell much love to them.
A number of poor children were at the meeting,
and I hope from among this class the Lord will raise up, in time, children unto Abraham,
even' as from among the stones.
A number of persons of higher degree attended also,
and I trust it was a meeting which will be remembered--
the Lord be praised for the help extended.

"`5th.--Attended the meeting at Coggeshall, and though I had a large time,
it was not so open as yesterday:
the circumstance of James Parnell being taken up in this place, revived in my mind,
and I had to mention it; also the great sufferings of Friends in those days,
and now how we are favoured:
I was in no danger of a prison for preaching the gospel of life and salvation.
After dismissing those not of our Society, I stopped with Friends,
and had a tendering good time.

"`6th.--Although favoured in meetings and in sittings,
and with a quiet mind at other times of late;
yet I could not but weep on my pillow this morning on looking forward.
O for purity of heart!
Surely, if this gives us to see the face of a merciful God,
it will have a tendency also to open the eye to see our duty clearly in all things.
The meeting at Copford was an open good time,
wherein I found it much easier to get relief than I often do.
Dined at an inn near by, and afterwards rode to John Kendall's at Colchester, who,
with his wife were at the meeting.
After tea I took a walk with George Gibson and John Kendall to the castle,
and went over the old ruins, where I was shown the hole in the wall,
from which it is supposed dear James Parnell fell when confined in this place; and also,
his apartment below, which looks like a baker's oven;
the thickness of the wall being about four times the length of my walking stick.
Went into the library, and saw amongst many old books, a number of Friends' writings.

"`7th, first-day.--The meeting was largely attended by Friends and various others,
and I had a full good opportunity; at the close,
appointed one at six o'clock in the evening, which was very large, and an open,
relieving time; in the course of which, I had to mention the sufferings of the martyrs,
and of our Friends in the beginning,
and particularly of that innocent youth James Parnell, in this place,
and advised the people to read his writings,
and seek and inquire after the truth for themselves.
They behaved remarkably solid, and left the meeting so,
even those who stood out of doors, who were many.
One person in the morning was much affected, and refused to go away,
though his companion urged him to leave the meeting--twice coming back for the purpose.

"`9th.--To a meeting held in a barn at Manningtree, which was large,
and an open good time: the people manifested much kindness,
several of them taking me by the hand and expressing it.
Rode to Harwich in the evening, and lodged at an inn.

"`10th.--To a large meeting in the market place, which was solid and comfortable;
the people showing much kindness and respect.

"`12th.--To a meeting at Halstead, which was nearly filled up with the town's people,
and a pretty open time: stopped with Friends afterwards,
and was engaged to stir them up to maintain the
precious testimonies given us as a people to bear,
and also to encourage the mournful travellers.

"`13th.--Went to a meeting at Colne under pretty close exercise and thoughtfulness,
respecting the uncertainty of all earthly comfort, and soon had to begin on this subject.
It was a tendering season to some.
There were present a number of poor aged people, leaning on their staves, one blind,
etc., and I was ready to think the plunge I had before the meeting,
and in the fore part of it, brought me into sympathy with such.
After dinner we rode to Halstead, and after tea to Joseph Smith's, near Stebbing.

14th, first-day.--Attended Stebbing meeting,
which was filled up with Friends from different places, and many of the town's people;
amongst whom I went poor and stripped, and continued so for some time; but afterwards,
strength arising, I had an open time.

"`15th.--After resting the greater part of this day we moved to E. Knight's,
at a little village called Fenchingfield.
This kind Friend, after the meeting on first-day,
mentioned his desire that I would have a meeting in this place:
it does not appear there ever was a Friends' meeting held here,
and none but himself and wife, under our name, reside in the village.
When we came to his house,
he took us to see an old bark house which he had fitted up with seats and a gallery,
and he was out until after ten o'clock giving notice,--
going about five miles off after we arrived.
May the Lord bless his faith and love to the cause in which I have embarked.

"`16th.--Went to the meeting, which was very large,
many being out doors--and it proved a favoured, open time; in which, through holy help,
my heart was much enlarged, and the people behaved solidly.
I remembered these expressions; 'I am the Lord that heals you,
that teaches you to profit; and which leads you in the way by which you shouldest go.'
Notwithstanding I exerted myself for a long time,
I felt much better than I did before meeting--the pain in my breast,
which I had had before, being removed.
In the evening had an opportunity with E. Knight, wife and daughter, to my satisfaction.
I have not met with greater faith and love, I think in this land,
than this Friend has manifested.
I thought of the governor of the island of Tortola,
who caused seats to be carried many miles on men's
heads to accommodate a meeting held by Thomas Chalkley.
+++[+++See Friends Library, vol.
6, p. 114.]

"`19th.--A struggling, humbling night:
and though I felt very poor and unworthy in the morning of this day,
and went so to the meeting at Haverhill, nevertheless,
I was much enlarged in a full meeting for the town; the house not containing the people.
I was informed that this was a place of suffering to our forefathers--now, what a change.
A priest attended the meeting, as well as a doctor and lawyer, and it was a solid time.

"`21st, first-day,--Went to Cambridge with James Wright and daughter,
where I met with George Gibson and wife.
When we went to the meeting, a multitude were gathered in the street and passage near,
and after the doors were opened, they soon filled the house, and it proved a solid time.
Dined at the inn with nearly forty Friends,
and had an opportunity with this large company,
wherein I endeavoured to persuade them to hold up their light before the people:
near the close several neighbours came in, to whom my mind was afresh turned.
After I had parted with dear George Gibson,
and he had rode about a mile on his way to Walden, he was not easy without following me,
and he overtook 'us and accompanied me to his nephew's at Royston.

"`22nd.--I find this morning that there is a little company under our name in this place,
and after some thoughtful exercise I was most easy to see them by themselves.
I accordingly had an opportunity with them; and a full, close time it was,
and dear George rejoiced that he came to us.
We then went to Hitchin and put up at Rudd Wheeler's.

"`24th.--Feeling easy to move from this place, Hitchin,
and mentioning it to Rudd Wheeler, he prepared to go with me.
We got into Amersham near dark, after riding about thirty miles.

"`25th.--Attended the week-day meeting; several of the town came in, and I had an open,
good meeting.
This is the town where the corpse, mentioned in Thomas Ellwood's journal, +++[+++See Library,
vol, 7, p. 394,]
was thrown from Friends' shoulders and laid in the street some time; and Isaac Penington,
Thomas Ellwood and others were put into prison for attending the funeral.
I was shown the place, near the market house.
After tea we went to High Wiccomb.

"`26th.--To the meeting at High Wiccomb,
and on the 27th got into Oxford and put up at an inn.
On entering into this town we were mocked by the children;
and I have not noticed more drunkenness any where in this land,
than in walking through this place this evening.

"`28th, first-day.--Went to meeting poor and stripped; it was very large and crowded.
A remarkable quiet attended the gathering, and continued throughout;
and the people parted with much solidity, to my humbling admiration; for it was an open,
good time to me, and I hope to many others.
At the close I stopped the few Friends that live in this place,
and we had a comfortable time together.
After dining we set off, passing through Witney, and arrived at Burford,
where we met a kind reception from Thomas and Elizabeth Minchell.

"`30th,--After a silent sitting with T. Huntley's scholars,
and the few Friends who live in this place,
I felt easy to move on,--passed through Tilbury,
where stands an old meeting-house of Friends, but no meeting is held in it.

"`31st.--Proceeded to Cirencester and put up with Thomas Brown.
To the week-day meeting at this place, which was a pretty open time:
in the afternoon went on to Bristol, where we arrived towards evening.

"`Ninth month 1st.--To Thomas Phillips', near the Wells,
where came the widow Ussher and daughter,
who are attending upon a daughter in a consumption, and near her end;
and a sweet season we had together.
When I met with them in Waterford, Ireland, they were gay women,
now so friendly and plain that I did not know them.

"`6th.--The meeting here was large, and I had a pretty open, relieving time,
though close to some states, yet a comfortable opening toward the visited youth.`"

While at Bristol he wrote a letter to his friend Susanna Horne, dated ninth month 7th,
from which the following is taken:

"`I parted from you with a cheerful mind, believing your stay with us was right,
and it was not long before a vacancy was felt by me,
who am frequently a poor blind creature,
but endeavouring to cast my care on the great Caretaker and Preserver of his servants,
I moved on from place to place, as way opened.
I had to admire how my spirit was supported in the season of
parting from my affectionate father and friend +++[+++David Bacon;]
the Shepherd of Israel being my support in that hour, enabling me to resign up wife,
children, and, I trust, all into his hands, who knows best what is best for us.

"`You have been favoured with a sense of my state in coming to this place,
and I seem at some loss how to describe the feelings of my mind.
However, this is the sum:
it was like going down into the valley and shadow of death,--O
the buffetings and inward presentations of evil,
both night and day, that I experienced; so that I have been ready to say.
Surely my soul dwells among lions.
At times all seems gone, and fear surprises me as in the night;
when former experiences are called in question,
and sometimes the apprehension stares me in the face, that,
after all I have passed through, deceit may so enter that I shall fail.
Such close things have escaped my lips, in two meetings I have attended,
that I have in some degree trembled in myself; and surely I have need,
considering what a poor creature I am.`"

"`8th.--To the meeting at six o'clock, and after sitting a considerable time silent,
felt a portion of encouragement to hold forth to the sincere seekers and mourners;
having first been favoured with a ray of light and encouragement myself.

"`11th.--Attended meeting here again, which was large, and a remarkable time.
O what a mercy and favour; and yet, afterwards the tempter was near,
who would whisper this language; 'Well done; you have had a large time.'
O may my soul be prostrated!
The widow Ussher and daughter Lucy, and other Friends dined with us,
and when we sat down to table I ventured to appear in prayer,
which proved a tendering season; the Lord be praised, and the creature abased.

"`12th.--A tendering time at breakfast, with a large number of Friends.
Two seeking people came to see me; one of whom went with me into another room,
and opened her condition, which was remarkable;
and said she never had felt so comfortable before in
the company of any people as this morning with Friends.
Attended the select meeting for this place, and I was brought into a state of trembling,
soon after sitting down,--remembering the language of the Master, where he said,
'With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you;
one of you has lifted up the heel against me,' etc., and had to express it with more:
and now I saw measurably into my exercise when standing at the grave of an individual,
whose funeral I attended a few days ago, and which continued upon me for some time after.
We could not get forward,
and so adjourned the meeting that more might be together next time.

"`13th.--To meeting, which was large, and a very open, precious time.
Sat with the members of the select meeting,
and before they got through the business I requested leave to withdraw;
this was a time to be remembered,--close and searching.
Feel much relief of mind, for which I know I ought to be, and hope I am,
thankful to the Father of living mercies, and willing to move on to the next work,
which may in wisdom be opened.

"`14th.--Had a solemn time in prayer with a number of Friends,
among whom were several tender minds; and it was a time to be remembered.
A young man who is under convincement came in, with whom I had a tendering time alone.
Parted sweetly from my friends at Bristol, and journeyed on to Bath, where we dined,
and reached Melkshara, twenty-four miles.`"

16th.--Got to Hungerford, and 17th to Reading;
where he tarried a few days to rest and wait for the holding of the quarterly meeting.

"`20th.--To the quarterly meeting;
and soon after sitting down my mind was brought under exercise,
and it proved a tendering time, but not a long meeting.
In that for business, I was favoured in testimony to the humbling of several present,
which was acknowledged to; and although things are low,
yet there seemed some ground gained against opposers.`"

The next day they got to Uxbridge, and on the 22nd to London.

In a letter to Rebecca Jones, written from London, he says:

"`It was pleasant to find you had got through your arduous task,
and to hear from others that you are cheerful.
You remain as a seal upon my spirit,
as one whom the Father of mercies was pleased to baptize in an eminent degree,
into a sense of my state before leaving home,--'
By one spirit you are all baptized into one body,
and made to drink into one spirit;' and O that I may be
accounted worthy to experience this baptism while in this land,
and to the end of my pilgrimage.

The love which flows in my heart reaches forth towards all the children and
servants of our heavenly Father's family in my native land,
as well as here.
There is a precious remnant preserved here, among all classes,
and great has been the love I have felt to the youth in this city,
both in meetings and in families.
If I may speak as an instrument employed in the Lord's work, I would add,
that there is a precious visitation extended to this class.
O the tenderness and gravity I have seen in some who are very young in years; so much so,
that I have been ready to say in the secret of my heart,
surely the Lord has begun a work in the minds of the children by the power of his love,
which will in time spread to the astonishment, as well as the comfort, of many.
Indeed, at times, I have almost been induced, in the opening which has presented,
to lay my hand upon the heads of some,
and tell them what good things are in store for them.
On the other hand, I have found your sisterly advice good,
not to be afraid of the rich and great.
Dear Rebecca, if my knees have not smitten together, they have at least trembled,
and Habakkuk's experience been mine, in degree,
when in the families of the great and towering ones,
desiring that they might find a resting place in the day of trouble,
which may be nearer at hand than many careless sons and daughters are aware of.
I magnify not the officer, but the office, and that adorable Hand,
who commissions and sends forth his servants; yes, I bless his name,
in that he is raising up labourers, one here and another there, in this land,
who appear hopeful.

"`27th, third-day.--To London quarterly meeting, which was large,
many of the youth being present: dear S. H. opened a door for me,
and I had an enlarged time of encouragement to all, but especially to the youth;
and I sat through the rest of the meeting for business,
with greater sweetness and composure of mind than I have experienced of late;
I also rejoiced with much joy,
to behold that weight had increased in this quarterly
meeting,--the business was conducted comfortably.

"`Tenth month 5th.--This morning feel more serenity and
calmness of mind than I have experienced for a length of time;
and now while making this note,
am anxiously desirous to cast away that labour and toil which have made my way,
at seasons, uncomfortable.
O that my heart may be lifted up to God in faith;
and in all things be given up to his blessed will,
that so I may be favoured from season to season, not only to know it, but also to do it.
Attended Grace-church street meeting; and it was an awful time, at least to me,
from these words; 'As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,
and every tongue shall confess to God.'

"`6th.--To the monthly meeting at Tottenham,
before which Susanna Horne spread her prospect of visiting the
families within Horsleydown monthly meeting,
and a minute was made setting her at liberty.

"`10th.--Wait on your God, O my soul, for the further unfoldings of his will;
who can turn his dispensations, as a man turns his water courses in his field;
and remember, that if the Lord's will is done, it is your sanctification and redemption,
under all trouble, whether outward or hidden.

"`11th.--To Horsleydown monthly meeting,
where I opened my concern to visit their families,
to the men and women before they separated;
my friend Susanna Horne following in the same manner; both were minuted,
and Benjamin Simkins appointed to accompany me, and Mary Smith, Anna Kay,
and Elizabeth Hobson, to accompany my female friend.
Dear Richard Chester came to this meeting, and expressed his sympathy.
In the first meeting I ventured to prostrate myself in supplication.

"`12th.--Very deep were my struggles and conflicts this morning: however,
they in some degree passed over before noon; about which time,
I took a walk to Thomas Phillips' and dined,
and had a tendering opportunity with the family; in my walk back, which was a lonely one,
my heart was tendered and broken,
and a language of sweet encouragement sprang up before I reached home.
But ah! how often do such sensations get dissipated.
Spent the evening, however,
more free from that weight of distress which has long been my humbling companion.

"`16th, first-day.--Felt my mind turned to sit with Friends at Horsleydown;
and it was a pretty comfortable time:
in the close mentioned a desire to see their neighbours together in the afternoon.
Many came, and I sat most of the time in silence, until several left the meeting;
but near the close I had to tell them how it was with me.
O that there was more of a true hungering and thirsting
after righteousness amongst the people in this city.
How little is done when the people's minds are turned outward.
In the evening the committee to arrange the families, met with us.`"

On the next day they commenced the family visit,
and although he had to labour along under much exercise, among many that he visited,
yet he, as well as his beloved friend,
were favoured to hold forth the language of reproof, encouragement, and instruction,
in the demonstration of the spirit, and with power.

From this period until the 8th of the following month,
he continued without much intermission, engaged in this service;
when they concluded to break off for two days and go to Tottenham.

"`Eleventh month 9th.--This afternoon I am tried with the prospect of more work,
in company with Susanna Horne,
our prospects being the same respecting visiting the families of Friends at Ratcliff,
and she is now returning home to attend the monthly meeting,
to open her concern and obtain further liberty and enlargement.

"`10th.--Went to Waltham very low in mind; indeed,
it seemed as if I could hold out little or no encouragement to my friend; she, however,
spread her prospect solidly before her friends, and it was united with.
This evening deep thoughtfulness attends me;
O that these fears and cares may prove my preservation,
by having a tendency to direct the mind to the only Helper.`"

The next day they resumed their labours within
the compass of Horsleydown monthly meeting,
which they finished on the 19th.

"`22nd.--To Horsleydown week-day meeting,
notice having been given on first-day for all the members to attend,
as well as such as are looking towards our Society: it was a very full meeting,
and I trust a solid one,
affording an opportunity to both of us fully to relieve our minds,
and it ended sweetly and comfortably.
Dined at Anna Kay's, the kind Friend who accompanied us, with Benjamin Simkins,
Hagger Allen, and various others; after which, I had a solid religious opportunity,
wherein these expressions impressed my mind; 'My peace I leave with you,' etc.;
and in my quiet sitting I remembered the last of the same chapter,
as I found afterwards on looking for it,
which seemed to me applicable to this finishing stroke, 'Arise, let us go hence.'

"`24th.--Attended Ratcliff meeting,
and after sitting most of the time under close exercise of mind,
I was favoured in looking over my stoppings of late, with a pretty composed mind,
and ventured to bend the knee in prayer for preservation; and after it,
there being a comfortable quiet over the meeting,
I opened my prospect before the men and women, of going from house to house amongst them;
and when the men met in their apartment they took it up,
and after expressions of unity and sympathy with me, it was minuted;
at which time my friend Susanna Horne came in and opened her prospect,
in a feeling manner, which was united with, and minuted also.
After meeting met the committee appointed to make arrangements for us.`"

On the 25th they commenced visiting within the limits of this meeting; on the 27th,
first-day, were at the morning and afternoon meeting, both of which were large,
and he remarks, "`I humbly hope were to profit,
although singular things escaped my lips in the last;
with a prospect that a day of distress is coming on the false teachers in the land,
and that the Lord will redeem his sheep out of their hands.
On the 29th, were with J. C.'s family, whom I visited sometime ago,
in company with Simon Bayley; it was then a singular time, and now also,
a tendering opportunity.
This has been a memorable day, and the opportunity at the widow P.'s,
like a seal that we have been rightly directed in labour together.
On the 1st of twelfth month, being fifth-day, attended Ratcliff meeting,
which was truly a remarkable time.

"`Twelfth month 4th, first-day.--To Ratcliff meeting, which was pretty large;
a number of neighbours coming in, and it was an open time.
In the afternoon the house was also filled up, in part, with strangers,
and I had a very relieving time.
A person who has taken down several testimonies in short hand, came here for the purpose,
but was persuaded to desist.

"`6th.--To the meeting-house at ten o'clock,
and met a number of persons mostly of our Society; and although,
when I arose this morning, and also in the fore part of this sitting, I was low in mind,
yet we had a satisfactory time.

"`7th.--This morning our kind host J. H., took us to Tottenham,
where we attended the select meeting;
in which Susanna Horne mentioned her prospect of accompanying
me into the families of Peel and Westminster monthly meetings,
and they set her at liberty to open it in the monthly meeting tomorrow.

"`8th.--My mind was humbled, and I ventured to bend the knee in prayer.
Susanna Horne came into the men's meeting, accompanied by her mother and Mary Smith;
and in a tender feeling manner opened her concern, which was united with,
and my mind is much relieved.

"`10th.--Spent most of this morning in getting ready to leave town,
and after dinner set off with George and Mary Stacey, in a post chaise for Uxbridge;
the chaise broke down with us by the way, which did not detain us long,
and about four o'clock we arrived at our friend Thomas Hull's, and met a kind reception.

"`11th, first-day.--Passed the meeting through in silence and much exercise.

"`12th.--O for more purity of heart in God's sight; that I may see my way,
and be favoured with armour to resist the wicked one.
Surely he has power to sift me as he did Peter.
O Lord forgive, empty me, and wash and sanctify me for your work.

"`13th.--Awoke in distress; but since breakfast, I feel a little more easy.
O that condescending love may vouchsafe to wash my feet,
and shoe me again with the preparation of the gospel for his work and service;
and if I am not abased enough, make me so.
I dread, I fear, knowing the slippery places there are to walk through:
'cleanse me from secret faults, let them not have dominion over me.'`"

The following is taken from a letter addressed
to him by his beloved friend Rebecca Jones,
dated,

Philadelphia, tenth month 26th, 1796.

Dear Thomas,

Your few lines of the seventh month, dictated in brotherly regard and sympathy,
came duly to hand, and like your personal visits formerly,
had a consoling effect,--my mind being often low and depressed,
yet not without a degree of humble trust in the goodness and mercy of an Almighty helper,
who has done great things for me--holy and reverend is his name, says my soul.
I rejoice in believing that the same good hand is with you,
and will be with you during your arduous journey; and when it is accomplished,
if I am in the body,
I shall be truly glad in your return to your dear family and native country,
with sheaves of enriching peace.
This will also, I trust, be granted to all my fellow-labourers from America,
now in Europe, some of whom I hear are doing valiantly.
You were all brought livingly into my view about two weeks ago,
under the influence of the spirit of supplication in our North meeting;
when a living hope was raised, that the Shepherd of Israel, who put forth,
will go before, and as he is listened to and faithfully followed, will give eternal life,
and none shall be able to pluck out of his holy hand.

"`15th.--In a poor and stripped condition I went to the week-day meeting in this place;
not knowing but that I should pass it in silent sorrow and mourning,
and so through the remainder of the day.
My spirit was bowed in secret humble supplication during most of the meeting,
and frequently thought I would have to go down on my knees, but the exercise lessened,
and such a sweet calm covered me towards the last,
accompanied with a humble hope that mercy was extended to me,
that my soul was thankful for this ray of light and love once more vouchsafed,
and withal felt a gentle pressure to stand up with a few lively expressions,
which I delivered, respecting silent worship and sympathy one with another under it.
After I sat down my companion Mary Stacey appeared in supplication,
and the meeting closed comfortably, I trust to more than myself.`"

From Uxbridge he went to Staines, to attend the monthly meeting;
and while there he wrote a letter, from which the following is extracted;

Staines, Twelfth month 16th, 1796.

Although I parted from you and left your father's comfortable habitation,
with seeming cheerfulness, yet,
I seem as if I can hardly forbear describing in
some degree the state I have been in since.
I thought I had seen an opening to leave London and spend some time at Uxbridge, Staines,
etc. and so pushed off in a very stripped condition indeed;
George Stacey and dear Mary accompanied me to Uxbridge.
But such a day as last first-day was, I have not often experienced; no,
I know not that at any time in this land, I have had a greater plunge.
I have not language, at present to set forth, and indeed,
it would not be profitable to endeavour to express,
the deep wading of my poor oppressed soul;
and in this scene I have passed through I even feared I
had not helped you forward in all respects,
on your journey, so you may see what a poor prop I am;
lean not to it any further than your Master gives liberty.
I had not the least opening,
either in the meeting or in any family--we came to this place to monthly meeting,
and here I was also emptied.`"

"`18th, first-day.--To the morning and afternoon meeting at Uxbridge,
which were seasons of close thoughtfulness.
I had a small communication near the close of the first, and was shut up in the last.
Drank tea at Thomas Finch's, and then stepped in to see Thomas Ashby's weakly wife,
and here I had to remember freshly,
my own tried state when in the chamber of a declining precious companion,
and the evidence I was favoured with in that day of her
being accepted of her God--and also had to mention it.

"`19th.--Spent this morning pretty much in reading,
and at three o'clock Mary Stacey and I set off in the coach,
and got to their house in Westminster about seven o'clock.

"`21st.--To Peel monthly meeting, in which I was silently shut up:
opened a prospect of visiting them in their families,
and my friend Susanna Horne also came into the men's
meeting and laid a like concern before them:
both were united with and minuted, and John Bevans appointed to accompany me:
but a low dull time to me.

"`22nd.--A very conflicting night, wherein jealousy, doubts and fears were my companions.
I have thought of late,
that I should be most miserable indeed if left to myself and forsaken
of my God,--if the potter should lay aside the lump of clay.
O for more watchfulness, reverence and becoming fear.
Will it not be better to lay down my life than live to dishonour that
truth which I have been favoured at seasons to espouse and plead for?
O the deceitfulness of the heart of man.
Lord have mercy, and help me through all that is yet to be endured.
That which I see not, teach me; and if I have done iniquity,
strength is only with you to preserve from doing more.
I hope my soul is humbled this morning.
To meeting and was favoured to get into a quiet and resigned state,
which indeed is a mercy.

"`24th.--This morning came Mary Stacey and her daughter Mary Ann,
who has been low in mind, and some communication arose freshly in my heart towards her,
in an encouraging line, and it had a tendency a little to raise my spirits;
for I have indeed felt, and may I not say been, an unworthy creature.
O how sweet is a little portion of heavenly bread.

"`25th, first-day.
It has been a very cold snowy time of late,
the thermometer this morning down to three degrees.
Thanks to the Father and fountain of mercy,
my mind feels more cheered and comforted than for a long time.
O that it may be a day of renewal of my espousals,
and may it please my good Master to strengthen me for further labour, if it be his will,
that so my task in this land may be accomplished to my own peace.
Why am I so much shut up?
Are there not some active minds that may be profited by me as a sign to look at?
Attended morning and afternoon meeting, and in the first felt enlargement in testimony,
and in the afternoon was quiet and comfortable.

"`26th.--To the select quarterly meeting,
and next day to the quarterly meeting for business,
and was once more favoured with an open time in the meeting for worship,
and found an opportunity to relieve my mind; also in the meeting for business,
respecting tithes, etc.
Dined at home, and after it had an open opportunity with a number of Friends,
among whom was P. B., a dear young woman in a tender state of mind.
Went to the adjournment, and here again relieved my mind.

"`28th.--To Peel meeting, in a low condition, accompanied by Rachel Smith,
where I met my beloved friend and fellow helper Susanna Horne.
I was somewhat relieved by prostration in prayer: dined at John Bevans',
at whose house we have taken up our quarters;
and in the afternoon began the family visit, accompanied by John Bevans and Mary Stacey.

"`30th.--Had an open time in the meeting at Clerkenwell school, both amongst those met,
and with the scholars: dined at the school,
and after it had a precious opportunity with the family, tutors and servants,
without the children; after which visited the old people, both men and women,
in the other house; and had a pretty satisfactory time;
and finding my companion's mind was not clear respecting the children,
we collected them together and had a good time;
and although one or two families were laid out,
I felt so spent that I was most easy to wind up for the evening,
and I hope the day's work will prove encouraging to them and us.

"`First month 1st, 1797, first-day: opens another year,
and very likely further trials may come upon me.
Went to meeting, and was shut up in silence.
Near the close of the afternoon meeting very close things escaped my lips,
and such was the weight and concern that rested on me after returning home,
that I could say but little, nor be cheerful in the midst of a large company;
and at six o'clock felt most easy to visit a family that was laid out for us,
which was a memorable time.

"`3rd.--After dinner set off in a post chaise to Uxbridge,
with a view of attending the burial of Thomas Ashby's wife, at Staines,
on fifth-day next: arrived at Samuel Hull's before night,
and felt a liberty to encourage Friends to invite their neighbours.
Spent the evening at Thomas Hull's, pretty calm and resigned, except one little miss,
for which I was humbled after lying down.
O how watchful a minister, a pastor, should be in all his conduct.

"`4th.--To meeting, at which a considerable number were collected: E. Bevington,
who is out on a visit to the meetings in Middlesex, was there and appeared;
but my mind was closed up again in silent conflict.
O what shall be done for the people in this land in places,
and when will the book of prophecy be opened, and their hearts also.
After dinner took post chaise and went to Staines.

"`5th.--To meeting, where the body was brought, and it was a crowded meeting,
but a very low time to me; I laboured in weakness, but to little relief:
doubting and fears very much prevailed in my mind, whether I was in my place.
After dinner we had a sitting with a large company,
wherein my companion appeared in prayer, and E. Bevington in testimony;
but I felt like a book sealed in this opportunity,
but some time after the company being more thinned,
my mind was suddenly brought under exercise, and I felt some ease by expression,
and again after tea, felt some enlargement in testimony.

"`6th.--Returned to Westminster.

"`8th, first-day.--Felt poor, and went so to Peel meeting and sat it through in silence.
In the afternoon meeting was also shut up in silence, viewing my steps,
when a total stop appeared necessary;
and my mind turned toward the monthly meeting at Westminster next fifth-day,
and see if way will open to make a beginning in that quarter.
From the first, both that meeting and this, seemed pretty much as one,
so far as regarded my concern; so I felt a liberty to tell my companions my thoughts,
and also the committee in waiting to lay out more families,
that the cloud rested on the tabernacle and it was safest to stand still.
Struggled along through the evening nearly as well as I knew how.
This evening a portion of Scripture was read, which is a practice I unite with.

"`9th, second-day.--To morning meeting, and sat it pretty quietly:
went afterwards with my companion and paid a sweet visit to S. R.,
her sister Sarah and sister-in-law.
After it, stopped a little while with two goodly servant maids,
and my mind has not been so refreshed for some time past, as it was under this roof.
Spent the afternoon and evening more free from depression, and before going to bed,
after the eldest daughter had read a chapter in the bible, we had a sitting,
in which we were both favoured to hand out suitable counsel.

"`10th, third-day.--Some little opening on my bed, into a further dispensation,
I hope of more light and liberty: but stop--why such anxiety?
Are not these dark and cloudy seasons profitable?
And can you not keep the faith, and also the patience, O my tossed soul?
O that this may be mercifully granted to poor unworthy me,
has been the language of my heart this morning; and may I be favoured,
to persevere through all; and may the Lord, in the riches of his love,
be pleased to grant me the blessing of preservation,
that I faint not;--then I know that all trials will work together for good in the end.
Here we are standing, I hope as servants in waiting; no way opening into any family,
and I am comforted in the remembrance of these expressions;
'Let your conduct be without covetousness,
and be content with such things as you have;' for he has said,
'I will never leave you nor forsake you;' so that we may boldly say,
the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

"`12th.--To Westminster monthly meeting, where we found William Rickman:
H+++.+++ F. appeared in a few words in supplication,
and my companion Susanna Horne immediately after her--
and then I had an open good time in testimony.
We laid our prospect of visiting them in their families, together with Mary Stacey,
before the meeting, which was united with,
and Josiah Messer and Lydia Forster named to accompany us.
Found letters from my dear Sarah and others,
and my spirit is bowed and humbled on looking towards home, and begs for faith,
patience and preservation.
O my dear wife,
how has the prayer of my heart gone forth to the Father
and fountain of all our mercies on your account,
that he may be your husband, your preserver, and your redeemer.
This day commenced visiting families.

"`15th, first-day.--To Westminster meeting,
and was favoured with an open time of enlargement in testimony,
much to the relief of my own mind.
Dined at George Stacey's, and accompanied by him, with my companion Susanna Horne,
went to the Park meeting, where the body of Francis Merrick was brought;
a Friend whom we visited in the course of our engagement in that meeting.
This was a remarkable meeting to me,
having to reason with the auditory concerning righteousness, temperance,
and judgment to come;--my mind was brought low and humbled after it.

"`22nd, first-day.--Went to Westminster meeting under feelings of poverty;
and to my admiration was strengthened to labour, both morning and afternoon,
largely and relievingly, and afterwards in an opportunity with F. S.'s large family,
where we had a precious time, so that I thought after getting home,
it was little short of a miracle of mercy extended to me this day.
Laid down peaceful and quiet, and thought I might soon retire into a comfortable sleep;
but in a little time it departed from me.
Thoughts of a humbling and trying nature were my companions,
but trust my will was reduced and resigned to the will
of Him who commissioned me to come into this land;
and has strengthened me to labour from time to time in it.
O the close and trying prospects that open, and yet I have no reason to murmur or repine;
for if the Lord my heavenly master does but go with me in them, I hope all will be well.

"`Second month,
2nd.--A degree of comfort on waking this morning in looking forward to future service,
with respect to which, I have of late been much blinded.
A little reviving hope, however, has sprung up, that way will be made, and the prayer,
I trust the upright prayer, of my heart has been for the blessing of preservation.
I covet not riches, or honour, or applause,
but the guidance of the good Spirit until the end come.
As some of our friends had been talking of attending Ratcliff week-day meeting,
I felt an openness in my mind to go and sit with them:
proceeding in the family visit in this place seems sealed up as yet.
I went accordingly to meeting,
and had a language of encouragement to hold out to those who are mourners like myself.`"

Charter-house Square, Second month 5th, 1797.

Dear friend,

Your acceptable letter, enclosing one from Samuel Couch, came to hand a few days ago,
and although long on the way, was yet seasonable, though indeed when I read it,
I seemed hardly to have a capacity afforded fully to understand it.
My experience in this land has often been, and continues to be,
that of being stripped and baptized;
and yet I hope there remain so much honesty and
uprightness in my poor and often wading mind,
that I dare not disbelieve, that although the Lord may be pleased,
for wise purposes sometimes unknown, but to be waited on to see the end,
to feed his messengers with the bread of adversity,
and give them the waters of affliction to drink, yet as says the prophet,
'your eye shall see your teacher.'
O blessed teaching has this been to me in days past, and surely I could not have done,
and cannot do yet, without it.
You have a little encouraged me by this language: 'Shall the exercised servants,
who are baptized into the state and condition of the people, conclude it is of no avail?
Necessary is it to guard against the grand discourager of all good,
and his subtle reasonings: the work that he would mar is often in as prosperous a way,
when hidden from our eye; so that there is encouragement to endeavour,
in simplicity and godly sincerity, to break up the fallow ground,
leaving the increase thereof to the great and good Husbandman.
From the faithful labourer sheaves of peace will not be withheld.'
Well, my beloved sympathizing friend, in reading these lines over,
and now again on penning them, I am willing to say.

Go on, O my soul, to the end of your journey here, and beg assistance to endure,
through all states what your wise and gracious Master may appoint.
Ah! here's the thing;
when I am favoured to see that my various baptisms are of his appointment,
then I do know that his will ever proved my sanctification.
But again, what is to be done when we are shut up in a close prison house,
and can hardly see any light through the grates?
I write to one who knows that his brethren in the ministry go
down in this day into the prison house,--surely then,
'the captive exile hastens, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit,
nor that his bread should fail.'
No mortal, dear Henry,
knows what I have passed through since putting my feet on the British shore; yes,
in my going off from home, and in the passage over the waters;
the thought of it at times humbles my mind.
I suppose I should not have written after this manner to you at some other times,
but am apt to do it as I feel.

I have gone through most or all of the families of Friends in this city,
except in one monthly meeting.
The wind has taken me ahead and I cannot move,
and am patiently (at least I hope so,) waiting for it to come fair for a movement.
What in the ordering of divine Providence may be my lot,
when this arduous business is got through with, is at present pretty much hid;
though I have not been without glimmerings in more favoured seasons:
did I say favoured--are they not all so?
O yes.

"`5th, first-day.--I went to meeting poor, but was favoured with a relieving time,
though very closely exercised with regard to various states.
In the afternoon meeting I was also much enlarged to the seekers present.
In the evening had several precious religious opportunities.
Heard after morning meeting, that dear old John Hill died this day.
Precious soul, may mine inherit the same as yours,
when divine Goodness may be pleased to end my day.
I loved you much in this world of trials and conflicts.

"`6th.--Began our family visit again, and on the 20th finished this service,`"

Having taken a very heavy cold a short time before they finished the visit,
he was confined to the house for several days from the effects of it;
on the 13th of the third month, in writing to his son, he says;

I do not remember to have had a heavier cold, or more pain in my head and face,
since I have been in England.
I was very carefully nursed at my friend John Bevans', Charter-house square, London;
not only by his wife and daughters, but my valued companion,
who though we had gone through our visit to that meeting, was not easy to leave me;
and when I was able to go out,
her mother and sister came for me and brought me to their
quiet and hospitable habitation in White heart lane,
Tottenham; where I have been mostly since.
I account it a favour that I am here in a state of retirement:
I have got so used to this kind family, and they to me, my strippings and baptisms,
that when I am here I feel under no bonds.
To give a little idea of my present state,
I have compared myself to a vessel that has been tossed in a voyage at sea,
and is unloaded, and repairs found necessary to be done, even to the keel;
and if I am again counted worthy to be equipped and sent off on another embassy,
it will be of the Lord's mercy.
I might enlarge on the subject, but am willing to leave it now,
and when further openings of duty present, I hope with cheerfulness to be enabled to say.
Here am I, send me.

In reference to his outward affairs, of which his son had the management, he says;

Dear David Sands told me once in New England, that what we do not gain in pence,
we may gain in experience.
May it be so with you, and may you be favoured to get on irreproachably.
It is a notable saying of the apostle, that 'They that will be rich,
fall into various temptations and a snare,' etc.: and I fear, now while writing,
that some of the young merchants amongst you,
who dare venture to trade above what they have of their own, and to a large amount too,
will be left to smart deeply when it may be too late.
O how sweet is a little of one's own, with content.
I never coveted to be rich and great in this world, neither do I covet it for you,
my son; and I comfortingly hope you believe me,
and are measurably convinced in yourself of that way in which you should go.
May the Lord, my blessed helper, strengthen, stablish,
and more and more settle you on the living foundation, to my rejoicing,
and to the rejoicing of his church and people.

In a letter of the same date, addressed to his much loved friend Rebecca Jones, he says:

"`Your acceptable letter came to hand the 13th of the first month,
just as I was entering into a family visit within Westminster quarter,
accompanied by Mary Stacey and Susanna Horne; since which,
I have gone through those of the Peel, which finishes the families of London,
making between five and six hundred sittings; and now after this arduous labour,
I feel myself a poor unprofitable servant.
Frequently have I remembered your counsel, not to be afraid of the rich and great;
and I trust, through marvellous condescending help, this has been my experience;
and very close things have escaped my lips, sometimes to my own astonishment,
and I suppose to that of others; and I have thought, that for some of those things,
satan, the adversary, has envied my poor, wading soul, and by various stratagems,
siftings and buffetings,
(for indeed he has been permitted to be a sore thorn in my
flesh,) has endeavoured to draw me down to destruction.
O, my dear sister, I cannot describe on paper, where I have been in this respect.
I have been examining and re-examinincr, and though weakness and infirmity are mine,
yet I trust I can say, I have not wickedly departed from the law and the testimony;
and have been led to beg that every corner of my deceitful heart might be searched.

Well, it has been so, and a degree of sweetness springs out of these bitters.
Have you experienced such a state as this, when abroad in this land,
when all seemed gone, and you could lay hold on nothing?
when heaven and earth were wrapped up as a scroll,
and you had again to wait for the creation of a new
heaven I O the unsearchable wisdom of the Lord,
whose ways are past finding out.
If this has been your experience at any time, and surely methinks it has,
then can you sympathize with me:
and O that you may be favoured still to pray to the Helper of Israel,
that the feet of your poor feeble friend and brother may not slide.

I do not write murmuringly, but I hope with a mind so far devoted,
that when I can be favoured to hear the language.
Whom shall we send, and who will go for us?
I can say.
Here am I Lord, send me.
O may my soul be preserved here, until the latest period of my life;
ever sensible that they who run, and the Lord sends not, cannot profit the great cause.
I have frequently visited dear Thomas Phillips in his illness,
who departed this morning about four o'clock.
He has been a deeply sympathizing elder to me;
and amongst other precious things he dropped,
said that he hoped the Lord would carry me through all my trials in this land;
and I think it was yesterday, after I left him, he had me called back, and said,
'Give my love to Friends in America; though I do not personally know them,
I sympathize with them in their late troubles.'
Some days before, while sitting by him, he said with tenderness,
'It is a low time amongst us: things are trying,
but there is a better day ahead for the young people.
What a comfortable thing to die in this faith--I
have loved the truth and good Friends,' etc.

Tell my dear absent family, that my prayers have been, at seasons, put up for them,
when so favoured, that that blessing which makes truly rich,
and which must be left to an all-wise Providence to dispense, when and how he pleases,
may be their happy experience.

"`Third month 31st.--Attended the burial of Thomas Hull, at Uxbridge:
we had a very crowded meeting, and in it I felt some enlargement to speak to the people.
Sarah Harrison was here also, and appeared after me.
Dined at the house of the deceased, and afterwards my companion and Mary Stacey, and I,
had an opportunity of relieving our minds amongst the relations.
I have not been opened in any public meeting or opportunity, except a few words,
since the 20th of last month, which closed our family visit.

"`Fourth month 1st.--Returned to London after an early dinner, and got there in good time.

"`2nd, first-day.--Went to Grace-church street meeting,
and O what a close time it was in pleading with the loose professors;
amongst other things that arose in my mind, was this, to advise them to read,
and let their children read also, that excellent epistle of Stephen Crisp's,
respecting the present and succeeding times, and also the trembling prophet Habakkuk;
and I felt some ease and relief.
Went to meeting in the afternoon, I trust, with a dedicated heart;
and though there appeared to be many strangers there, all was sealed up.
I could do nothing; but stopped after meeting and encouraged one of this number,
who kept his seat, and told me he was expecting something.
I commended him to the grace of God for his teacher.

"`Fifth month 3rd.--Spent the time between the
3rd of fourth month and this period at London,
Newington, etc., in a low, exercised state; and it is this day five months,
if I remember right, since the date of the last letter from my wife;
of whom I have thought with much anxiety and solicitude:
it is not unlikely that my letters may have miscarried,
as we learn the American vessels of late are taken.
This morning felt my spirit much oppressed; took a lonely, solitary walk into the fields,
and there poured out my sighs and tears to the Father and Fountain of my mercies;
I remembered his gracious dealings with me when
in the wilderness of Carolina and Georgia,
and how often, when riding in lonely places on the road, London was set before me,
and that I was to hasten to prepare for the voyage to this place.
But O, the strippings of favour I have experienced since being in this land!
The buffetings of satan; the thorn in the flesh--the fears,
lest I have slipped in some degree; yes, that I have not at all times stepped aright.
My soul was poured out in prayer for mercy and forgiveness,
and for patience to endure the singular trials I have to encounter,
and was favoured with a secret, soul-sustaining hope, that although I have long had,
and it may yet be continued, to walk through the valley and shadow of death,
that my most merciful Lord will give me to experience a
table spread in the presence of my enemies;
and that the bitter cup will be sweetened,
so far as to enable me yet to drink thereof to some profit.
I humbly hope I can make this appeal unto him;
'You know I neither seek nor desire either outward or inward great riches,
but of your appointment, and to be led in a plain path, because of mine enemies;
therefore, O Lord, sanctify the present dispensation, and forgive all my secret faults.

"`Sixth month 9th.--No settled and fixed prospect since
finishing the family visit in Feel monthly meeting,
which is now between three and four months; and since yearly meeting was over,
my mind has been very deeply exercised and tried.
Some little opening towards a movement has presented, but it lasted not long,
and has closed up, and now my condition, in a state of blindness,
is very trying to the man's part.
Sometimes for a little moment there has been such resignation,
faith and patience experienced, as have hushed all; and again,
when I consider the distance I am from my home, and how long I have been away,
and no clear opening to move out of the neighbourhood
of London,--fears and doubtings arising,
as to what man may think or say of me.
I have slidden into a low spot.
O that I was more steady, and bore up under all my weights more uprightly!
O my soul, banish as much as possible a murmuring spirit.

"`11th, first-day.--Arose in a low state this morning:
David Sands set off soon after breakfast, accompanied by Joseph Smith,
to Wandsworth meeting, and requested I would come to him in the afternoon,
he having some thoughts of a public meeting in that neighbourhood.
After he was gone I took courage and went to Ratcliff, accompanied by Thomas Richardson,
and through the renewed extension of divine love, had an open, comfortable time:
some strangers came in, and one man appeared much affected.
About three o'clock Truman Harford and I started for Wandsworth,
and found a meeting appointed at five o'clock; it was pretty largely attended,
and I was silent.

"`12th.--T. H. took me to London in his chaise, to attend the select meeting,
where William Savery mentioned his distress at
finding one of his testimonies was published,
by a man,
who for sometime has been employed in taking
down what has been delivered in our meetings,
which does not meet with our approbation.`"

The following extract is from a letter to him, dated, Uxbridge, sixth month 10th, 1797,
written by Ann Crowley:

"`I trust my beloved friend will excuse me for troubling him with a few lines,
which I believe I should not have done,
but from an apprehension that liberty is felt to
communicate a little of my tried situation,
to one who often travels in the deeps,
and is thereby qualified to administer a word of
counsel to those who may have had less experience.
Such has been the stripped state of my mind for a long season,
that I have often been tempted to let go my confidence,
and conclude it was impossible to hold on my way,
and that I must inevitably fall by the hand of my enemy.
At other times, am ready to think that I have been under a delusion,
and have not yet distinguished the voice of the true Shepherd; and thus,
as well as with various other discouraging circumstances, has my faith been tried,
until it is reduced to a very low ebb.
The language formerly expressed by one, who no doubt felt his lonely situation,
often seems applicable to me,
'I am like a pelican of the wilderness--I am like an owl of the desert; I watch,
and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.'
None seems to fathom the exercise of my tribulated soul,
nor knows the bitterness of my heart:
yet it is possible this may all be ordered in best wisdom,
and sometimes I am ready to hope it is; for if these trials are rightly abode under,
I have little doubt but they will tend to drive
the soul home to that safe place of shelter,
which I believe has been found by many to be a secure hiding place,
even from the greatest storms.
Here our dependence becomes more solidly fixed on that all-sufficient Arm of help,
which is able to support in the needful time; when, perhaps,
if greater opportunity was afforded, I might be induced, from a hope of getting relief,
improperly to disclose the painful situation of my mind, and seek for inferior help,
when nothing short of that divine consolation,
which comes from the Fountain of inexhaustible good, immediately handed to my soul,
might be permitted to prove sufficient to revive the mind in hope.
Thus I am enabled, at seasons, to endeavour to reconcile my mind to my tried allotment.
I sincerely wish, my dear friend,
to be preserved from saying anything which may increase my own poverty,
or give uneasiness to your feeling mind, and if I have done so,
I am quite willing to stand reproved, and desire your entire freedom herein.

I frequently wished, during my late stay in London,
to spend a little time in your instructive company;
but feeling myself unworthy of the conversation and society of
those whom I so greatly preferred in the truth,
to myself, I had not courage to seek it, but retired much alone,
bemoaning my own weakness and poverty, concluding that none knew how it fared with me.
When I heard some of my beloved friends expressing the overshadowing of
divine good which was so largely to be felt in some of our gatherings,
and the sense of gratitude which dwelt on their minds for such favours,
my soul was introduced into a state of lamentation,
fearing that my heart was become obdurate,
because I could not sensibly partake of that
heavenly enjoyment and soul-sustaining virtue,
which many others appeared to share, and whereby the soul is kept alive unto God.
But through all, I am ready, at seasons, to lay hold on the hope,
that a state of poverty and desertion is seen to be most profitable for me,
and that these proving seasons are not always intended as a rod of chastisement.
I think I can, at times, feelingly breathe this language; 'Search me, O Lord,
and try me and know my way,
and if there be anything in me which prevents
your great work from going forward in my heart,
do away with it: let not thy hand spare, nor your eye pity,
until you have made me what you would have me to be.'

It is not my intention, by thus addressing my endeared friend,
to be pouring out the language of complaint,
for I am truly sensible that I have been made partaker
of many more favours than my little dedication merits;
but being fully convinced that you are one of
those who have passed through many tribulations,
and whose baptisms have been of a fiery nature,
I thought I felt something more than a bare liberty to
unbosom a little to you the tried state of my mind,
believing that deep can utter unto deep, and that it is those only,
who have trodden the same suffering path,
who can availingly sympathize with minds buried in suffering and death.

It may seem presuming in me, whose experience in divine mysteries is so small, to say,
that my beloved friend has often been brought near in sympathetic remembrance,
and according to my small measure I have felt strong desires that you
may experience a daily increase of that faith and patience,
which enabled many of our ancient worthies to bear the burden in the heat of the day.
When favoured to look a little beyond the present day of suffering,
and call to mind that at the end of the race,
a crown immortal is given to all the faithful dedicated servants in the Father's family,
it animates us to press through the many crowds of difficulties which arise in the way.

"`20th.--David Sands and I had some instructive
conversation together respecting several matters,
and hope I have gained something by it.
Returned to my chamber from a secret impression on my mind,
in order to prostrate myself at the footstool of my gracious Lord and Master,
and felt some relief.
O how precious is one little ray of light and life dispensed, and a living hope revived,
which enables me to say, Lord I desire to wail your time for enlargement.
Ah! it is good to be content, even to be shut up as in prison,
and not to cast away confidence then, though the doors may appear to be fast secured.
No way opens clearly, either to go home to my family and friends,
or to any place in this nation; and what can I do but endeavour after resignation.
So be it--stand fast, O my soul, and yet look up unto your only sure Helper,
who has forgiven you much, and has done much for you in past days, and even in this land,
in keeping you from sinking in the hour of trial.

"`22nd.--To Ratcliff monthly meeting with E. Janson, Phebe Speakman, and M. Horne,
where we met Mary Watson and sister.
Dined at Truman Harford's, and a singular opportunity occurred,
in which I thought Phebe Speakman was much favoured to
speak to the state of the heads of this family;
something like giving in my witness, appeared to be my duty,
and Mary Watson concluded the opportunity sweetly, I thought, in prayer.

"`28th.--Went with Sarah Harrison to Grace-church street meeting,
where I poured out my tears, and after it prostrated myself in prayer.
Felt a willingness to go with Sarah Harrison as far as Uxbridge,
and leave London in such a way as not to return, if way should open.`"

The following is taken from a letter addressed to him by his beloved friend Mary Dudley,
dated Bristol, sixth month 23rd, 1797.

Your farewell salutation, handed me on the evening previous to my leaving London,
was truly cordial to my mind, which had been so much with you,
that I was about setting out to seek a little of your valued society.
However gratifying this might have been to me, I was content, and I may say, thankful,
in being remembered by you, as you have been by me, in a nearly uniting manner;
and several times have I wished to salute you as an endeared
brother in the fellowship and tribulations of the gospel.
This is a track in which from feeling sympathy, I do believe your exercised spirit moves,
and through which perhaps, in like degree, many are not passing,
although each one may conclude his own burden enough.
I remember while writing the language, 'He trod the wine press alone,
and of the people there was none with him,' and believe there may be, in measure,
a similar experience in the line of painful exercise,
although in the present superficial slate of things
such may appear to have neither form nor comeliness,
like their blessed Master.

Well, my dear friend, 'You, O God, see me,' is a precious appeal,
and what an abundant mercy that he peculiarly regards
and owns such as are resigned thus to be baptized,
and with heartfelt submission drink the cup of suffering: these will not only know him,
their suffering Lord, and the fellowship of his sufferings,
being made conformable to his death,
but will also assuredly experience the power of his resurrection,
and after these baptisms unto death, feel an increase of pure spiritual life.
But why should my pen run on thus, as though such a poor creature as I am,
could administer any relief or encouragement to your tried mind,
which has been so abundantly instructed from on high, for the sake of others,
so that I have often said, you need not to be ashamed.
He who, by His own divine power,
has caused you hitherto to bring forth these things out of your treasury,
designs not now to shut up any longer than may
qualify for increasing faithfulness in his work;
and though I can often scarcely discern my own way one step,
I have so much faith respecting your way clearing up, that I was ready to say,
that perhaps even now, the renewings of the heavenly commission await you;
and though I feelingly observed the declension of your bodily strength,
surely the great healer of breaches can do all in this respect, as you and I,
my dear friend, have had cause often to acknowledge.`"

"`30th.--Went with Phebe Speakman and Ann Crowley to a little meeting at Rickmansworth,
eight miles from Uxbridge, held in the parlour of Emmet Skidmore,
in which dear Ann was drawn forth in an extraordinary manner;
and returned back in the evening to Uxbridge.

"`Seventh month 3rd.--After rising this morning I felt more cheerful and resigned,
and this little pleasant feeling causes thankfulness.
O how easy a thing it would be to the great
Disposer of events to change the dispensation,
even as streams in the south; and thereby cheer and comfort my wading mind.
Forgive, O Lord,
and have mercy on me,--then might I be favoured to teach transgressors your way,
and by the help of omnipotent power, sinners might be converted.
O that the dispensation I am now passing through may be looked at hereafter,
if my life is spared a little longer, and do me good in the latter end.

"`4th.--Drove Ann Crowley to Jordan's to a meeting,
appointed by Ann Alexander and company;
we found a rough way for a few miles of the latter part;
Ann and her sister and Ann Crowley appeared, and I was shut up in silence.
The house was nearly full, and mostly made up of women of the middle or lower rank,
some few excepted, who came in light and airy; a few men of the first description,
and less of those of higher rank.
Methought as I sat amongst them,
what a change! probably I sat in or near the place where those favoured men,
Isaac Penington and William Penn formerly did,
when they could look over a large gathering of living professors,
and very likely often handed forth to them living food from the Lord's heavenly table,
to their mutual refreshment.
Now, if the few Friends were away from before me,
there would appear few or none but women with scarlet cloaks,
in a raw undisciplined state.
Alas! how has the crown fallen from off the head;
and yet what evident marks of the footsteps to be seen.
A neater meeting-house is not often to be seen, and many conveniences about it;
and the grave yard is in nice order.
We ate our dinners in an upper chamber, a cold fare, but to me it relished well,
and reminded me of many such occasions in the wilderness of America.
I learn that two ancient men keep up this meeting twice a week.
I returned back to Uxbridge with my friend, and Ann Alexander went to Wiccomb.

"`6th.--Truly I am a poor creature,
and seemed this morning as though I could hardly lift a finger towards prayer;
like one that had become bankrupt--broken to pieces: perhaps when this is truly so,
my good Master may graciously be pleased again to make me up.
I am ready to query whether ever there was such a one sent over sea; and yet,
O that I may be favoured even in the fires to glorify His great name,
whose work and word is a deep mystery.
After dinner Ann Crowley proposed a ride, with which I closed;
and she and R. Hull and I rode as far as where Isaac Penington used to live,
within sight of Chalfont.
It is a pleasant rural spot, with a deep valley not far from it,
and a grove of fine trees in and around it.
The ancient garden walls are standing,
and the one next the road is built partly of small flint stones and partly of brick:
it is about two miles from Jordans.

"`8th.--I hear that Ann Alexander and sister, and David Sands, are not far from us,
appointing meetings amongst other professors; and here I am, blind, poor and naked,
but not miserable; because I humbly trust I am not standing still thus, from day to day,
in my own will.

"`13th.--Took a solitary walk on the commons, in a low exercised state of mind,
and endeavoured to cast my whole self on the everlasting helper of his people.
O how often could I fall prostrate on the earth, and bewail my state;
but there is a secret stay and a language, be patient--be still.
After dinner I again took my lonely walk--my bodily strength seems recruited,
and O that patience may have its perfect work respecting my spiritual strength,
or so much as the Lord in mercy may please to grant.
I cannot move in my own will or desire, to his praise and honour.
O that I may not bring reproach on that ever blessed truth,
which I hope and trust has been espoused by me through holy help in days past;
and I dare not believe otherwise now, though my little preaching seems to be, as it were,
out of the prison window,
or through the iron grating,--for soon after I am shut up again.

"`17th.--To Tottenham and met with George and Sarah Dillwyn, Phebe Speakman,
and her companion Ann Crowley.
After dinner dear George supplicated, and my mind was tendered,
and once more had a small Pisgah sight of good things.
It was indeed pleasant to have a little prospect of what gospel ministry is,
and I ventured to hand forth some encouragement to those afresh setting out,
although so shut up myself.

"`23rd, first-day.--Did not feel so much oppression as sometimes on awaking this morning.
O that I might be favoured this day to cast away the labour
and toil that have so often made me feel uncomfortable,
and lift up my heart to God in faith;
feeling a holy resolution formed by it to give
up in all things to the Lord most merciful,
to follow on to know him.
Surely in the midst of all these deep plunges, my soul craves this,
and dare not let him go.
Better is it to die than to bring dishonour to the great name.
O you searcher of hearts, and trier of the reins of men,
you know my condition and can speak to it.
Turn out every wrong thing from my heart--root out every wrong plant,
and grant me contentment under your humbling hand.
I went to Tottenham meeting, where I found Mary Watson; a quiet,
calm resignation spread over my mind in my walk there, and soon after sitting down,
an exercise spread, and the sight of the people assembled added weight to it,
some of whom were at the last meeting I attended at Grace-church street,
which was a remarkable time.
My exercise increased,
and cleansing virtue from the divine presence was experienced in my own particular.
O! methought,
what a mercy once more to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living;
and feeling strength and boldness given me, I stood up with these words:
'he that has a dream let him tell his dream; and he that has the word of the Lord,
let him speak it faithfully; for what is the chaff to the wheat, says the Lord.'
But what most rested on my mind, was the fresh revival of these expressions, 'Son of man,
behold I take away from you, the desire of your eyes,
with a stroke;' and as my soul has of later months been
made so deeply sensible of this taking away,
and even my pleasantest enjoyments have been crumbled as into the earth,
I had not only to humble myself in telling the assembly so,
but to reason with them of righteousness, temperance and judgment to come.
Mary Watson concluded the meeting in prayer, and in the little pause before we separated,
my heart was thankful that these words were made good to me: But you are washed,
but you are sanctified, but you are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus,
and by the spirit of our God,' even by the washing of
regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.
It is indeed a miracle of mercy--let reverence possess my soul,
and a willingness to bow to His sovereign will and pleasure, from hence forward,
and guard against a murmuring uneasy spirit, I trust that through all,
this has not been charged against me, even in the midst of extremity,
for there has been something which has kept my head above the waters;
and I have been afraid of appearing to others, in this uncommon detention,
to be a man at ease.
The afternoon meeting was large, and in it I also laboured.

"`27th.--It is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord even
suddenly to make a poor man rich:--these expressions have
revived this morning on getting up and making this note.
Truly my detention after this manner is very
marvellous--it is a trial of faith and patience;
yet I am much more favoured than I deserve.
Went to meeting at Tottenham and was largely exercised in testimony to various classes,
and felt comfortable and quiet after it.

"`28th.--Awoke and arose quiet and more easy in mind, and my soul craved ability to say,
I will trust in and rely on you, O my God.

"`30th, first-day.--To Tottenham meeting once more.
I could not persuade myself that I was worthy to stand forth;
but as there were so many of the gay and rich, etc., I endeavoured to discharge myself,
and was very closely engaged on the subject of death.
In the afternoon was again exercised in testimony, it being a large meeting.

"`Eighth month 1st.--In the night season, I had a little to rejoice in the prospect that,
after all, the Lord can make things new; and if it is his divine pleasure,
fit me and send me into some part of this island to labour,
and in the conclusion favour me to return home with peace.
O my travailing soul, wait on God, who will strengthen you, and be ready to go forward,
when the cloud is taken up, if even but a little: and O, says my soul,
that if there are fellow servants preparing to accompany me to my native land,
that the great Master will be pleased to accomplish his work in them,
and cause them to be in readiness.

My beloved friend and fellow traveller and labourer, and I,
had an opportunity this morning of conversing together,
and my soul craves that our care and sympathy may not go beyond the altar,
but that through all, preservation may be graciously granted,
even unto the everlasting kingdom, where I trust my dear Elizabeth, the wife of my youth,
has gone,
and where I have been favoured with strong confidence to believe my
dear Sarah will be favoured to arrive in the Lord's time.
My inward cries were put up in the night season,
that almighty Goodness would bless my dear children
with a more abundant knowledge of his ways.
I trust I can appeal unto Him and say.
You know I covet not great things in this world for them,
but that if their lives and mine are spared,
(and these I desire to resign up) they may cause my
soul to rejoice in beholding them your servants.

My desires have also gone forth at seasons for my dear aged parent,
that the Lord may more and more prepare her,
as a shock of corn fit for the everlasting garner,--so be it, O merciful One; and,
for your name and mercy's sake, look down upon your struggling servant and forgive,
and do and give what you, in your unsearchable wisdom, see to be best for him.

"`3rd.--Lay awake for hours last night, pondering my ways,
and the cause that such a path is my lot;
and although these things are too mighty for me fully to comprehend,
yet I hope my soul was brought measurably into a contrite state,
with feelings of holy fear and resignation, which were exceedingly pleasant,
even in the midst of the fires.
Sometimes I am ready to break forth and say.
You know, O Lord, I am willing to follow you into any part of this land, or further,
if it is your will, and your presence goes with me;
but even here I am stopped with a humbling sense, that I know not what to ask for,
without it is faith and patience to endure what the Lord may see best for me,
either in staying or going.
I went to the week-day meeting, and was favoured with a good degree of quiet throughout,
and a humble hope and trust revived, that if the patience is kept, way will open.

"`4th, sixth-day.--I hope I am in a waiting state,
with a willing mind to go at my divine Master's command;
and yet such is the weakness of my mind, that I fear there has been,
and perhaps may now be, a lack of faith to set out.
But surely it has been my soul's delight to move in the living faith,
and to be employed in so glorious a work as preaching the gospel.
O that it may in mercy be granted again, in the Lord's time, not my time.
It is close work to keep the patience in extreme poverty, week after week.
Notwithstanding all, this springs up as a comfort,
that if I am favoured to travel along and bow to the heavenly will,
all things will work together for my good at last.

"`7th.--O that I could be favoured once more with a ray of living hope,
and a belief that I am the Lord's servant; worthy to be further entrusted in his work,
that I could forget, as much as is right and profitable, the things that are behind;
things acted and transacted heretofore,
and experience the mantle of adorable love and mercy cast over all my infirmities,
which appear to be not a few,
and be favoured patiently to wait the Lord's time for
further opening into service in this land,
if further labour is my lot.
I cannot hasten his coming--O for trembling submission to the Lord's blessed will.

"`8th.--O adorable High Priest, your mercy,
pity and love are an over-balance to all that my wading soul meets with; therefore,
it has not sunk into despair.
Forgive all my iniquities, that have so closely encompassed me about: I cannot,
I dare not, hide anything from you, you all-seeing Judge,
for your penetrating eye goes through the whole earth.
O Lord, continue your protecting care and mercy to those whom your poor,
unworthy servant has left behind, for I desire to hope and trust in you, O my God.
Amen.

"`20th.--To Tottenham meeting, which was large; and I had once more a full and open time.
I ventured also, to bend in supplication, not only for myself, but for others;
begging for the blessing of preservation, and the forgiveness of sins and iniquities;
and that this meeting might be a time to look
back at in seasons of stripping and desertion,
as one of mercy and kindness.
To afternoon meeting at four o'clock,
and had to address the visited children of our heavenly Father,
several of whom I had cause to apprehend were there.
In the evening felt comfortable.
O what a miracle of mercy, extended to such an unworthy one!
The Lord be praised,--and O for steady faith and
reliance on the divine Arm--come what will.

"`22nd.--Took leave of the family of Thomas Horne, who have shown me much kindness;
it appearing to me that my time was nearly run out in this place,--Tottenham;
where my soul has been deeply plunged.
O Lord, be pleased to reach forth your forgiveness, mercy and truth,
and open the way for your poor, unworthy servant.
Grant me ability to leave the things that are behind,
and reach forward in an upright desire to do your will only:
without you I can do nothing to profit or peace,--but by and through your power,
all things are accomplished that tend to your honour.

"`23rd.--Went to Grace-church street meeting, and sat it in pensive silence,
but was favoured so far as to see it right to go to Uxbridge.

"`26th.--Set off with Joseph and Rachel Smith, and arrived safely at Uxbridge,
and lodged at John Hull's.

"`27th.--Attended the meeting, where was Sarah Lynes from London,
who is on a visit to the north; she appeared in the ministry, but I was silent,
as well as in the evening meeting.

"`28th.--I have looked to see whether any known duty has been shrunk from in this land;
even when the hand of the Lord has been heavy on me,
and my soul has been bowed down under temptations and
trials which have been permitted to assail me,
and I see none.
I felt pleasant in two visits made to E. W. and family, and W. F. and wife;
children whom the Lord has favoured me in days
past measurably to beget through the gospel.

"`29th.--Felt a comfortable calm this morning, with liberty to go as far as High Wiccomb,
fourteen miles, where I rode on horse back.
In the afternoon several Friends stepped in to see me, with whom I had a pretty open time.

"`30th.--Attended the week-day meeting, and pretty soon after it was gathered,
Sarah Lynes and Elizabeth Stephens came in, and likewise a number of the town's people,
and we both had communications.
After dinner I had a religious opportunity with a number of Friends,
and then set out for Oxford,--and on descending Church hill,
was shown a place called Crowell, near which, in the valley,
I was informed Thomas Ellwood's father lived: the prospect around was beautiful indeed.

"`31st--After breakfast, accompanied by William Hull,
proceeded on our journey to Chipping Norton, where we put up at William Atkins', who,
with his wife and children received us gladly.

"`Ninth month 1st.--Attended the week-day meeting, which was a pretty tendering time;
and on the 2nd we set off about eight o'clock,
having first had a sweet religious opportunity with the family,
and arrived at Birmingham about dusk, having travelled forty-two miles:
here we found Ann and William Alexander.

"`3rd, first-day.--In the meeting, which was large, I had to sound an alarm to some,
and to offer consolation to another state: and in the afternoon had a full,
comfortable time, many of the town's people being collected;
my two female friends had also a share in the labour.

"`5th.--Left Birmingham about eleven o'clock, accompanied by Joseph Shipton for a guide,
(a young lawyer,
who came into the Society by convincement:) William Hull also was with us,
Stopped at Litchfield and dined;
after which took a walk to the market place and town hall,
where we understood William Savery had a meeting.
We lodged at Burton on Trent.

"`6th.--Went on about seven miles, and stopped at Derby to breakfast;
and while Joseph Smith was transacting a little business, I took a walk into the town,
through the graveyard, and to a great building with a high steeple.
My spirits were oppressed, and I felt dejected and low.
My thoughts turned to George Fox and his imprisonment;
and if my exercise has been in sympathy and
feeling with a state of deep trial and suffering,
into which he and some of our forefathers were largely introduced, I am content;
for I can feel little opening towards the people at large.
O Lord, hasten the day of Zion's redemption and prosperity:
bring down pride and haughtiness, and that ranting, unbelieving spirit,
which is so prevalent in this land,
and set up your ensign of righteousness more conspicuously;
and grant that my soul may still be supported to answer your requirings,
either in doing or suffering.
The country round about Derby is very fine, but the road to this place hilly.
After dinner we proceeded on, and arrived at Chesterfield, where we lodged.

"`7th.--Sat with Friends in their week-day meeting, which was small;
and though I felt much weakness, ventured to express my feelings.
After dinner we rode to Sheffield, where William Fairbank and wife received us kindly.
In the evening a large number of Friends came in, with whom I had a religious opportunity.

"`8th.--Went on, accompanied by William Fairbank, passing through Wakefield,
and arrived at Christiana Hustler's after night,
where we found a pretty large company of Friends,
it being the day on which their monthly meeting was held.
Felt my mind light and easy; but when I laid down did not feel so well,
fearing that in this state of liberty, I in some degree broke bounds:
O the necessity of watching at all times.

"`9th.--Left Christiana Hustler's about eleven o'clock,
and passed through Keighley and Thornton to Martha Smith's, sister of my kind landlord,
who, with his wife, are still with me.
We crossed a steep mountain,
which reminded me of my journey over the Alleghany mountains in America.
We passed through a fine country lying to the north--saw the town of Skipton,
and the village called Carlton, about one mile from it;
the last place is where Markham lived,
the priest who cast Friends of Lotherdale into prison at York.

"`10th, first-day.--Was accompanied by our London friends, Joseph and Rachel Smith,
and others, into the dale called Lotherdale,
where we found a pretty large gathering of Friends and others; and I had an open,
tendering opportunity amongst them.
We dined at Mary Stanfield's, whose husband, John Stanfield, is a prisoner at York,
for tithes, at the suit of priest Markham;
after which took a walk with Joseph Smith to the old meeting-house,
to look at the ground, they proposing to build a new one.
My heart went forth in love to dear Joseph,
while he was sitting by my side in the meeting, on remembering to have heard him say,
that he intended to build a new house for these poor Friends in this place;
and I did believe, that in so doing, the Almighty would bless him.
I felt comfortable and easy among this peeled little company;
who live in a vale as poor and lonely, I thought,
as some places on our Alleghany mountains.

"`12th.--My mind has been turned this morning, towards my dear wife, children and family;
and as respects some of them, with sighs and tears; and yet with desire, I trust,
uprightly to say, 'Your will be done, O God, and let mine submit in obedience to it.
O preserve your servant in this his lonely state.'
We rode to Settle, and got to the select monthly meeting about five o'clock.

"`13th.--Arose low and poor.
If the Lord keep not the city, the watchman wakes but in vain;
except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain who build it.
May I cast myself, therefore, on him,
hoping and trusting still in his mercy and goodness; for indeed I am often a poor,
solitary one.
Attended the monthly meeting at eleven o'clock,
and had to communicate pretty largely to several states.
Two women walked, yesterday, from the Dale, about seventeen miles, in the rain,
thunder and lightning, to attend the meeting.

"`14th.--Felt a little revival of hope before leaving my bed this morning.
How often have I been tried with respect to some singular testimonies which
I had to bear in London,--when my mind has been almost ready to sink;
and yet, through all, I hope and trust I can say,
it has been the desire of my soul to act and speak uprightly,
and I must leave the issue to the Lord most merciful.
I recollect particularly, what a very painful, wakeful night I had,
previous to one of the last opportunities at Grace-church street,
when Ezekiel's situation was revived, and I handed it forth.
My spirit was pressed down with it in the night while lying on my bed.
I have thought my spiritual state, for months past, has resembled that of the prophet,
when the widow fed him--his was an outward need,
as expressed in the Old Testament,--mine is inward; he was fed by the widow,
who had naught but a little meal in the barrel, and oil in the cruse,
and yet it held out through a time of drought.
O that the great Prophet may be pleased to sustain and
help me through this time of stripping and famine,
who am mostly in a state of much weakness and blindness,
and yet trust a little portion of faith and hope yet remains,
although it be comparable to the handful of meal in the barrel,
and a little oil in the cruse.
Returned to Martha Smith's at Thornton.

"`16th.--Felt no opening to appoint a meeting in this neighbourhood,
and seem much a blank; yet hope, that as a scholar in the school of Christ,
I am getting this lesson by heart,--Your will be done.

"`17th, first-day.--Joseph Smith went yesterday to Skipton, and before he set off,
after endeavouring to get enough into the quiet to hear the Shepherd's voice,
I ventured to encourage him to appoint a public
meeting to be held there on second-day morning,
and another at Lotherdale, to be held this morning, with which I felt easy.
After breakfast, accompanied by Joseph Smith, got into the Dale about ten o'clock,
and climbed up a steep, slippery hill,
and had a satisfactory opportunity with a large
number of what are called Sunday scholars.
Some tenderness appeared amongst them,
but I was much spent from the closeness of the room, and the breath of so many.
Went to the meeting at eleven o'clock, which was very large,
and an open relieving time--the people behaved solidly; I felt much fatigued, yet,
after a tendering time with the exercised woman
whose husband is in York castle for tithes,
and others who came in, I set off across the mountains, the near way for Thornton.

"`18th---Got into Skipton about ten o'clock,
and found that our meeting was to be held in a Methodist meeting-house,
the one belonging to Friends being small,
and as the other had been offered to Sarah Harrison when here, and the same person,
a considerable man in the town, offering it again for our meeting,
Friends were free to accept it.
It is very commodious, and I had an open, comfortable time in the meeting,
and hope it was so to several who were gathered.
The name of the person who offered the house is Peter Garforth;
and I learn that his sister built it,
and that a goodly solid woman who was at our meeting,
proposes building one a little distance from this place.

"`22nd.--To Kendal week-day meeting; and though for sometime I sat in poverty,
yet afterwards was a little comforted and cheered, and set at liberty,
not only to warn the unruly, but to hand forth some comfort to the feeble minded.
Dined at George and Deborah Braithwaite's with several Friends, and after it,
Joseph Smith, George and I, took a walk to the old castle, and looked over the town;
we also went into the large old steeple house,
and I had the curiosity to step it on the inside, and made it 144 feet by 105.

"`24th, first-day.--The meeting today was but a low, exercising time in the beginning:
I laboured earnestly amongst them, and very closely, from these expressions,
with which E. Robinson, a young woman lately convinced,
closed her testimony before I arose 'Bring forth, therefore,
fruits fit for repentance,' etc.
This young woman, I am informed,
is turned out of doors by her mother for coming amongst Friends.
The evening meeting was put off until six o'clock,
and though I gave no liberty to invite any, yet it was large,
and very close and exercising labour fell to my lot from these words;
'Seek not death in the error of your life.'

"`25th.--A pretty calm mind this morning, though under conflict on my bed,
in reflecting upon the little effect which religious labour
seems to have on the minds of the people in the present day.
O the independent, atheistical spirit that prevails over many,
and has even entered and gained some ground in our religious Society.
How often is my soul afflicted and bowed under a
consideration of the slate of the high towering ones,
who know so little of the afflictions of Joseph, or the imprisoned seed.

"`27th.--We got to Cockermouth, having rode forty-two miles.

"`28th.--Attended the select quarterly meeting, which was large,
and it fell to my lot to be closely engaged in a searching manner.
At two o'clock, went to the quarterly meeting, in which I had a full,
relieving opportunity, both in the meeting for worship and that for discipline.
We had the company, at dinner and tea, of Sarah Talbot,
and her companion Sarah Shackleton of Ireland, and Mary Sterry and Mary Watson,
much to my comfort; and when we sat down to dine,
my heart was enlarged in prayer for myself and fellow labourers,--and
that the young people of this family might be blessed;
and that we might be favoured in the present quarterly meeting, etc.

"`29th.--To the parting meeting at nine o'clock,
and after all my friends had an opportunity to relieve their minds, I had a full,
relieving time, and Mary Watson closed in prayer.

"`30th.--Rested pretty well,
and through favour feel my mind calm and resigned to the will of my heavenly Master,
with breathing desires that I may be favoured to know him to go before,
and to know his voice; then surely, let what requiring soever be opened,
it will be my duty to say, 'Here am I, send me!' so be it, says my soul,
in humility and reverence.
After breakfast we left Cockermouth, and passing through Preston, arrived at Whitehaven,
where we put up at the widow Jane Pearson's.

"`Tenth month 2nd.--Had a singular opportunity with three of Jane's grand-children,
who though at first, light, were brought plentifully to their tears; after which set off,
stopping at Keswick to dine, and got into Hawkshead late, where we lodged.
This was a lonely but instructive ride to me,
amongst the mountains--many sheep were feeding on the sides of the hills,
and interspersed among them are lakes of considerable extent.

"`3rd.--Drank tea at Clement Satterthwail's, where I had a satisfactory opportunity,
in which a dear Friend, Hannah Wilson, who is eighty years old,
and lively and green in her old age, joined in a short testimony.
How comfortable to find a seed preserved, who are accounted for a remnant.

"`4th.--Took a walk over the meetinghouse and grave-
yard--the latter had seats of stone all around it,
fixed in the wall; and in the middle a wall about as high as a seat,
which the old Friend told us after we returned, was so constructed, she understood,
in order to hold meetings there, in ancient times.
In coming to this place the day before yesterday,
we rode for sometime in sight of a hill called Pardsay Cragg,
perhaps ten miles from Cockermouth, where Friends in the beginning,
held their meetings in the open air--when the wind and rain beat on one side of the hill,
they removed to the other, and it appeared to have ridges one above another, like steps,
as if formed for the purpose of seats.
Dined early and set off, and got to the ferry house at Windermere lake,
kept by a blind man.
Our horses were taken over in a large boat, and the rest of the company,
with our friend John Bragg, took to a smaller one, and rowed around Curwen's Island.
The prospect is beautiful indeed to the eye,
the land surrounding it being covered with shrubbery, fruit trees,
and a comfortable looking house;
but when I heard that the person who owns it was offered £ 20,000 for it,
and would not take it, although containing only about forty-two acres,
I thought what a pity so much should lie as it were dormant, when there are so many poor,
so many widows and fatherless children ready to perish.
After landing we found there was no post chaise to be had, so my kind London friends,
Joseph and Rachel Smith,
were obliged to put up with a cart and a boy to drive them nine miles to Kendal,
and it was a mountainous ride, and very entertaining.

"`5th.--To the select quarterly meeting, where very singular things were delivered by me,
although an utter stranger; but I heard afterwards, that they were pertinent:
here I was met by Mary Sterry and Mary Watson.
The quarterly select meeting was held at three o'clock in the afternoon,
and the monthly meeting for Kendal in the morning at ten o'clock.

"`6th.--To quarterly meeting, where the labour fell mostly on me,
and I was favoured with a full, relieving time, both in the meeting for worship,
and afterwards in that for discipline.
I went also, into the women's meeting with Simon Harker,
who expressed a concern in a lively, tender manner, to visit families.
Attended the parting meeting at six o'clock,
and we sat nearly or quite two hours in silence, and to me it was a sweet,
refreshing time, such as I have not frequently been indulged with; and in the close,
I had a short testimony to deliver.`"

In a letter from this place, dated tenth month 8th, 1797, he says:

"`Which way I shall move from this place, I know not at present,
and am content with my allotment, even when going a zig-zag course.
I have been used to it in my native land, and through mercy it is made easy enough now,
and I am daily trying to learn this important lesson, 'Your will, and not mine, O God,
be done;' and if preserved here, whether heights or depths, principalities or powers,
life or death, may, in unsearchable wisdom be dispensed,
all things will work together for good.
I may just add, and that with humility and thankfulness of heart,
that I have been favoured with much enlargement in these two quarterly meetings, namely:
Cumberland and Northumberland and Kendal, and trust,
acceptance in the minds of my friends.`"

"`10th.--To the week-day meeting, which I sat through in silence,
and felt content and cheerful after it.
Soon after dinner set off, accompanied by Joseph Smith and George Braithwaite,
all on horse back, to Ulverstone; we had a mountainous ride of twenty-one miles,
and crossed lake Windermere, and got into town after night, about seven o'clock.

"`11th.--Attended Swarthmore meeting, about a mile out of town; and after it,
took a walk over to see the remains of the old hall, where judge Fell lived.
It is in a ruinous condition, having gone much to decay;
the room where they used to hold meetings, and which stood on the left of the entrance,
is quite dilapidated.
The entrance is paved with flag stone;
on the right hand is a large room with a curious old fashioned window,
somewhat like the modern projecting bow window; it is two steps up,
and in it stands an old chair,
on which was marked "`T. T. 1642,`" There is curious wrought work, in parts of the room,
and I think it was flagged.
The staircase is a very singular one, with curious carved work, and goes up to the roof.
One of the chambers has very old fashioned cut work over the chimney place,
and around it, and on the edge of the hearth stone.
The once beautiful garden and orchard, and the walls round them are all in ruins.
The meetinghouse is neat and comfortable, much such a one as that at Jordan's:
there is a good wall around a large grave-yard, with trees about the house,
the two nearest the door not much unlike our pines or firs.
Over the door is inscribed "`Ex. dono G. F.,
1688;`" and I was informed he purchased the ground of one of his daughters-in-law,
and ordered the house to be built, but never saw it.
+++[+++See Friends' Library, vol.
I. p. 96, 97,]
There are yet two very old fashioned oaken chairs in the small part of the meeting-house,
which he gave to Friends.
One of them Robert Widders used to occupy, and John Taylor, of this country, the other;
both are of very curious workmanship.
There w&s but a small company of people at the meeting,
but with thankfulness I may record, that both on going up the road to meeting,
and soon after taking my seat, my mind was comforted.
After dear George Braithwaite had spoken my feelings in a few words,
the meeting was gathered into a comfortable frame,
and I ventured to bend in supplication;
and then was pretty largely engaged in an encouraging line, especially to the youth.

I thought I had a prospect of a renewed visitation to this place in a day to come,
and mentioned somewhat of it to the meeting.
In the silent part, I remembered a portion of the ninety-first psalm,
and had a secret hope that I might lay hold of it for my encouragement;
for indeed I was once more favoured to feel the salvation of God near;
even Him who is the blotter out of sin, and the forgiver of past transgressions;
and who said 'I will show him my salvation.'
In the evening, after walking up a high hill and taking a view of the town,
the bay and the place where George Fox was dragged by the rude,
persecuting people and nearly killed, and looking into the old steeple house,
I had a solid religious opportunity with several Friends.

"`12th.--After breakfast my mind was impressed with a
prospect of going again to Swarthmore hall,
for when we left it yesterday, as the woman who keeps it, let us out of the gate,
my mind was rather unusually turned towards her,
and as this concern remained with me on my bed,
both on lying down and during my wakeful moments in the night,
I told my companions I must go back--so they, with Elijah Salthouse the elder,
went with me.
Soon after getting in,
I asked her if she was willing to send for her sons out of the harvest field,
(for they were drawing oats,) and with her two grown-up daughters,
sat with us for half an hour in a religious way.
She soon had her sons in, with one other young man and a lad,
with whom we had a baptizing time.
One of the grown-up sons had lately returned from off a man-of-war,
on board of which he had been decoyed: he was much broken into tenderness and tears,
in the opportunity, and told me on parting,
he was disposed to remain and help his mother,
his father having recently died after a short illness,
O the sweet peace I felt in and near these old ruins, as well as after I left them,
from an honest discharge of duty.
We left Ulverstone, stopping near lake Windermere to tea, and got to Kendal about dusk.

"`14th.--I have occasion to acknowledge that the Lord has been my strength and my song,
and also my salvation: he has opened and enlarged my heart in this north country,
and wrought a willingness in me to follow him further, if the way should open.
I had this morning a baptizing tendering time on my bed, with humbling prospects,
and many tears.
O may I be favoured to abide constantly in the will of God, who has led,
and also fed me in this land, with food suitable and convenient for me,
although it has been the bread of adversity, and at times,
the bitter water of affliction; yet mine eye still beholds my teacher; and now,
instead of going further north, I must turn a little back,
and what matter if it be by the way of the wilderness,
so as it is the way of my heavenly Master's good pleasure;
then by following on fully and faithfully,
all my trials and deep inward conflicts will no doubt be blessed and sanctified to me.

"`After several religious opportunities in families, we set off,
and passing through Yealand, we got to Lancaster, and put up at David Dockray's,
and soon after we got in, a newspaper was put into my hands,
containing an account of the yellow fever having appeared in Philadelphia.

"`15th, first-day.--Attended the meeting, and was favoured to relieve my mind,
first with a language of encouragement and consolation to the children,
babes and sucklings in the church, and afterwards with a rod to false professors.
In the afternoon at three o'clock, most, if not all of the morning company came again,
with the addition of some strangers, and I had a large, open and relieving time;
so much so, that I not only thought, while speaking,
but said that it looked likely my stay would not be long in this place;
for in other cases where there has been an opening and strength given to relieve my mind,
there has been liberty also to go pretty soon.
Drank tea at W. Jepson's, and soon after, there came in some orphan children,
grand-daughters of Elizabeth Wilkinson, who was in America with Alice Hall;
and I felt very sweet and comfortable toward them,
and had encouragement to hold forth to them, but otherwise to another state present.
O how this unbelieving, independent spirit grieves and pains my best life.
In the evening a Friend came in, who had with him New York papers,
giving a further account of the fever, of which about sixty persons had died;
it appears to be much like that of '93.

"`16th,
second-day.--I hardly knew whether my mind was most in sympathy with
the sick and distressed in Philadelphia yesterday,
or dipped into the state of the meeting here, as I found it when amongst them:
I had to tell some of the company, that they were wearing linsey woolsey garments,
sowing their fields with various sorts of grain, and ploughing with an ox and ass, etc.,
and my labour was close indeed.
To-day a Friend told me that there is a young man here who is convinced,
and comes to this meeting, whose mother threatened him much if he thou'd her, etc.,
which he believed it was his duty to do.
She went to some of the gay Friends belonging here, to make her complaint,
and said to them, she wished, if her son must go to meeting,
that he might be such a Quaker as they were, who could attend meeting, and yet say you,
and use the world's language in other respects.

What a rebuke this was.
After dinner, parted with my friends, George Braithwaite and J. W.;
I felt easy to go towards Sheffield, and set off and rode twenty-two miles to Preston,
and met an open, kind reception from William Brown and his sister Alice.
I had a sweet ride here, because of that ease and peace of mind I enjoyed.

"`17th.--We passed through Blackburn and Haslenden, and arrived at Todmorden,
where we lodged.

"`18th.--Awoke stripped and poor this morning,
and endeavoured to prostrate myself in humble prayer to my great and Almighty helper,
and trust I heard the still small voice, saying, 'Go to Sheffield.'
Samuel Greenwood, a young man of this place, offering to accompany me,
we journeyed on to High Flats, and just before we got there,
I thought I had the most extensive prospect of any I had seen in this land,
from a barren, high hill.
We arrived at Sheffield after forty-six miles ride,
and put up with my kind friends William and Mary Fairbank.

"`19th.--Arose this morning fresh and well, and now a consideration arises,
why such haste to get back to this place?
O my soul, wait in patience, for there is peace administered thus far.
In my lonely ride, and especially during the latter part of the day,
my thoughts were turned home to my family, and poor Philadelphia;
and such has been the favour vouchsafed amidst my deep conflict,
that there has been a fixed evidence sealed on my mind,
that if an all-wise Providence calls some of my dear family hence,
and I should not be permitted in this life again to enjoy their society,
there is a place of rest and peace prepared.
What a consolation this has been, at seasons, to my wading mind.
O then let me leave these things to Him who judges righteously.
Attended the week-day meeting, and was favoured with a satisfactory time.
I told them that I had come nearly one hundred miles to attend this meeting;
and in the close felt liberty to say,
that it would be pleasant to have the neighbours
invited to come and sit with them on first-day.

"`21st.--Was informed that Friends have provided
a large building formerly used as a foundery,
about 32 yards by 20, and fitted it up with benches and a gallery,
to accommodate the meeting on first-day; their own house being small.

"`22nd, first-day.--Attended two very large meetings.
It was computed that three thousand people were at the one held in the afternoon.
Both of them were very satisfactory to my mind.
After the morning meeting a captain of horse in this place,
came and attempted to speak to me, but when he took me by the hand,
he turned away and left me--he came again in the afternoon,
and then told me his heart was too full to speak to me in the morning.
In the evening we had a sweet religious opportunity in
prayer and testimony at William Fairbank's.

"`25th, fourth-day.--To meeting,
which was thought to be three-fourths filled with journeymen, apprentice lads, etc.;
it was solid, and they left it in a commendable manner,
affording considerable relief to my mind.

"`26th.--To week-day meeting held in the large house, many of the inhabitants attended,
and it was satisfactory to me, finding much enlargement.
At the close I appointed one for female servants, etc., to be held tomorrow afternoon.

"`27th.--At eleven, accompanied by William Fairbank and Thomas Colley,
I went to the work-house, and had a meeting with the poor people,
and a large number of poor children;
which was to satisfaction,--several of the overseers or managers being also present,
who were respectful after the opportunity.
At three o'clock, attended the meeting appointed for female servants, etc.,
which was much crowded, and on the whole a satisfactory, relieving time,
though I had to stand up in much weakness.
The people were long in getting out,
and towards the last the tutoress of a school for poor girls,
who had brought her scholars to meeting,
and had seated them in the back part of the house, came forward with them,
and placed them before me, under the gallery,
and I had a satisfactory opportunity with them.`"

In a letter to George Dillwyn, dated the 28th of this month,
after speaking of his release from London, etc., he says:

When I returned last to Kendal, my way seemed closing up respecting the north,
and opened towards Lancaster: this seemed like going back,
but as the prospect fixed pleasantly on my mind, giving up thereto afforded sweet peace.
From there, this place opened,
and fastened with more weight than any prospect for some time,
and what appeared singular was, that I must hasten, and be at their week-day meeting.
Some reasoning took place on the way; what should be the cause I knew not,
whether to go into sickness myself,
or hear of the sickness or death of some of my friends;
but being favoured with strength to perform the journey,
as the intimation to my mind was, so it has been performed.
'Go to Sheffield and it shall be shown you what to do.'
I found much to do, and have been helped, if not to much profit to others,
yet to the relief of my own mind.

After speaking of "`the faith and zeal`" of Friends in fitting up the large building,
and the character of the meetings, which is described pretty much as in his diary,
he says:

Dear George, this is a singular line in which I am led; yet,
let the wits of this world say what they may,
and I have been often deeply tried with this spirit, so prevalent with some,
my mind has been convinced and confirmed in the belief,
that the revelation of the mind and will of a most glorious High Priest, has not ceased,
but is continued, more or less, in his church, and to his humble depending children.
I have been querying why I should write thus:
is there not occasion for such a poor thing as I to lay my mouth as in the dust?
Yes, and it has been so often, in this land of high profession;
but surely there is still a power sufficient to make the very stones cry out.

The following account of this visit to Sheffield is from another hand:

"`On the 18th of tenth month, 1797, Thomas Scattergood came to Sheffield,
and attended our week-day meeting next day, where he had much service,
principally addressed to the youth;
and at the conclusion mentioned his intention of staying over first-day,
requesting that Friends would invite their neighbours to come and sit with us.
As our meeting-house was not large enough to
accommodate a great many more than our usual attenders.
Friends obtained a very large building, erected for an iron foundery,
which was unoccupied, fitted it up with a gallery and comfortable seats,
and met there on first-day.
The meeting was very largely attended by the inhabitants of our populous town,
and Thomas was remarkably led to speak with convincing authority,
awfully calling on the company to consider the uncertainty of time,
and prepare to meet their God;
telling us in how singular a manner he had been drawn
here,--that when about one hundred miles distant,
he felt a strong and forcible attraction to Sheffield,
accompanied with an intelligible language in the secret of his heart,
which followed him day and night, 'Go to Sheffield, go to Sheffield,
and there it shall be shown you what you shall do: hasten you, hasten you.'
It was truly awful, and seemed to spread seriousness over the assembly;
his testimony was long and very powerful.
The afternoon meeting was still more crowded,
it being estimated that three thousand persons were there;
and in that meeting also his services were very great.
To the surprise of the audience, the voice of our dear friend held out wonderfully,
and in the evening his very countenance bespoke the peace of his dedicated mind:
a remarkable degree of solemnity prevailed in both these meetings.
After supper he had a memorable opportunity in my father's family,
several young Friends being present;
and after commemorating the greatness of divine power displayed that day,
he addressed several persons in affectionate and encouraging language.

"`On fourth-day morning, the 25th, another meeting was appointed at our friend's request,
and held in the same large building, for the male sex solely,
chiefly apprentices and working men of the manufactories in the town;
and it was attended by a large number.
On fifth-day, our usual meeting-day, a large number collected,
and he was again enabled to minister to the various states of the people,
to the admiration of many.
At the conclusion of the meeting he expressed a
desire to see the lower class of the female sex,
such as servants, etc., exclusively, the next afternoon at three o'clock.
The meeting was accordingly appointed, and a large number collected;
it was computed that more than two thousand women were present;
they were called upon by our dear friend in an awakening manner,
to prepare for their latter end,
and various states and stations were feelingly addressed:
the girls of a charity school present, with their teacher, were particularly addressed,
and the children reminded that women were the first promulgators of the gospel.

"`In the forenoon of the same day,
Thomas had a meeting in the poor-house with the families, pensioners, and a few others.
On first-day, 29th, had two other very crowded meetings,
attended by (it was believed) three thousand persons,
in each of which he preached in the demonstration of the spirit, and with power,
imparting many gospel truths, and touching upon the subjects of baptism,
spiritual worship and our belief that revelation has not ceased.
In the afternoon he was led to explain some of our peculiar tenets; amongst others,
disapprobation of oaths and war, the latter of which,
he said was one of the noblest testimonies we have to bear.`"

In a letter to his wife about this date,
after alluding to the accounts which had reached him,
of the progress of the yellow fever in Philadelphia, he says:

"`This seems more than a bare report, and if true, is awful indeed.
I have gone through abundance, in deep thoughtfulness about home, etc.,
frequently in this land, and could write much about it; but it may suffice to say,
that since this account has reached me, my mind has been closely exercised; and yet,
through mercy, and indeed to my humble admiration,
possessing much quiet and resignation to the will of Him who judges righteously,
and does all things well; and I know I cannot add to, or diminish by taking thought.
You may naturally think, my dear,
that I shall be under much anxiety to hear and
know how things go with you in Philadelphia,
and in my family; and if you are spared, it will be of adorable mercy;
and if so ordered that some of us never meet again in mutability,
strong has been my faith at times, when looking towards you,
that our heavenly Father is near, and that whether in life or death, all would be well.
This has cheered my drooping soul, when looking towards my family,
and I have had renewed cause of late,
after a very great conflict which was heavy upon me for months,
to believe that I am in my allotment, and trust,
under the protection of Him who feeds the ravens, and without whose notice,
not a sparrow can fall to the ground; and if further trials await,
O that my soul may be favoured to say in truth and with uprightness, 'Not my will,
O Lord, but yours be done.'`"

"`29th, first-day.--Unwell last evening, with some cold and sore throat,
which increased in the night, and feel poor in spirit this morning, and humbled.
I trust mercy and kindness is with the Lord, who can heal and help.
Went to meeting, which was very large, and a fine open time of much enlargement,
for which I felt very thankful to the Lord, my most merciful, holy and mighty helper.
O that my soul may feel after preservation in the future, come what may.
To afternoon meeting, which was also very much crowded, and to my great admiration,
a time of enlargement.
O what a favour to get well through such large meetings.

"`Eleventh month 1st.--Very weak and poor with respect to moving on, yet Derby, Derby,
seems to sound in my ears in the same manner as this place did a week or two ago.

About eleven o'clock, after some close thoughtfulness, came to a conclusion to go,
and my kind host William Fairbank, inclining to accompany me,
we rode to Chesterfield and were kindly cared for by Mary Storrs,
her husband being with Ann Alexander and sister Mary in Wales.
Before we proceeded any further,
I thought best to authorize her to write to Friends at Nottingham,
to engage them to go to Derby and procure a large place for a meeting,
and invite the inhabitants to come together on first-day next,
after which we rode to Mansfield.

"`3rd.--Spent this day pretty quietly at Richard Leaver's,
except taking a little walk through the town, and found it pretty much in confusion,
it being the day that servants, both male and female, come to offer themselves to hire.

"`4th.--This morning my soul has craved animating strength,
and I am ready to say forgiveness also; fearing there has been too much indulgence.
We set off for Derby, and got in about dusk, and found several Friends there,
who had procured the county hall, and fitted it up with seats.
This evening we had a meeting at the inn with most of the professors in this place,
to satisfaction.

"`5th, first-day.--Held two large meetings, much to the relief of my mind;
a very great crowd attended in the afternoon,
and though there was much unsettlement at first, I was favoured to get along,
and the meeting ended well,--Truth being in dominion over lightness.

"`6th.--Felt an openness to go into the families of the few professors in this place,
and accordingly visited seven or eight families;
on the whole my services have yielded solid comfort and peace to my mind,
and now the query arises.
Lord, what further would you have me to do?

"`7th.--Felt a liberty to move on to Castle Donnington,
where we had a religious opportunity in the family of George and Ruth Follows.

"`8th.--Went to meeting and a considerable number of the town's people came in;
Ruth Follows opened a door for me to preach the gospel,
and it was a tendering opportunity towards the close, I hope to satisfaction.
After this my mind was turned towards Nottingham,
though it appeared like going back again; and we arrived there a little after night.

"`9th.--Went to meeting in a low condition and sat long in silence,
but towards the close had some very close things to say,
and afterwards encouragement and consolation to the widows and fatherless,
and exercised ones.

"`10th.--I took a lonely walk in the park back of the castle and dropped a silent tear,
and was comforted in being thus alone, and yet not altogether alone,
for I remembered with sweetness this passage,
'thus says the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy;
I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
and who trembles at my word.'
O how sweet is retirement;
here I remembered the many lonely and deeply exercising
times I had when walking near Tottenham;
and also some of the walks on Uxbridge common; how my way was hedged up at times,
and at others,
some sweet moments in submitting to the dispensation of an all-wise Providence,
and yielding up my will to the trying prospects that frequently presented.
In my lonely walk this morning my soul bowed in prostration,
and begged for preservation to the end of this pilgrim journey,
and was favoured in some degree to see the good land afar off.

"`12th,
first-day.--This meeting was a singular one--my
heart was much enlarged to various states,
and I had to reason with some concerning righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.
It was a tendering meeting, and a Friend told me that a youth said,
he could not attend to business after meeting on fifth-day last, he was so affected.
The Lord have the praise of his own work.
To afternoon meeting at half past two o'clock,
which was pretty much filled up with strangers, I thought of a serious class,
and it proved a satisfactory time.

"`15th.--Attended the meeting at Mansfield, and had a pretty open time, and on the 16th,
was at meeting at Sutton, where considerable tenderness and solidity appeared.
Thomas Kirksham, who had been a priest, and was well acquainted with Friends' principles,
seeing there was room in the house, sent for his scholars, and when they came in,
my heart seemed moved within me in love towards them.
The goodly master rejoiced particularly on seeing one
of the wildest boys much reached and tendered.
The meeting was a comfortable strengthening one to me,
and in the close I prostrated myself in prayer.
William Fox told me there was an atheist at Derby meeting,
who said there must have been something supernatural
attending such a discourse as was delivered there.
I presume it is the same one who said he did not think
it possible to be so reached by the ministry of any man.
'Rejoice not, says our Saviour, in that the devils are made subject unto you,
but rather rejoice that your names are written in heaven.'
May the Lord have the praise, and man's mouth be laid in the dust, as mine often is.

"`17th.--To a very large meeting held in a malt-house;
it was supposed that not much short of two thousand people were present,
and it was an open, solid and satisfactory time, of much enlargement to me;
several persons on coming out expressed their satisfaction, and blessed me in their way;
but the Lord have the praise who helped me much.

"`18th.--In our ride to Litchfield to day, we saw the place where George Fox was born.

"`19th, first-day.--Went to a meeting in a dissenters' meeting-house;
Friends had it cleaned out and fitted up with seats very commodiously.
The people were slow and long in gathering, but it was a pretty thorough time,
in which I had to mention the remarkable circumstance
of George Fox's going through their market place.
Dined at the inn with upwards of thirty Friends,
and had a singularly tendering opportunity with them,
opening the importance of their setting a good example in trade, dealing, etc.,
after which I felt easy to proceed to Sutton, and then to Birmingham.
This was a sweet and pleasant ride to me,
and I received a full reward at the hands of my Lord and Master,
for labouring to fulfil my duty in going the late round, ending at Litchfield.

"`22nd.--Attended a meeting appointed about a mile and a half out of town,
which was large, some of the principal inhabitants being at it,
and it proved an open and relieving time, several subjects being treated on,
and I trust a solemn alarm sounded.
I had to tell them,
that however some in our Society were as a stink in the
nostrils of God and man in consequence of their evil conduct,
yet there would be a gathering to this people,
for the Lord had raised them up to bear testimony to his truth, and would support them.

"`23rd.--We set off after seven o'clock, in a post chaise,
and passing through Stratford on Avon and Skipton, arrived at Chipping Norton,
and went to William Watkins', where we found Friends had not appointed a meeting,
it being "`fair-day,`" and they had held their week-day meeting today on this account.
The thought struck my mind rather singularly on coming into the town,
whether a meeting had been appointed, and I thought if Friends had not done so,
that the prospect was likely to be taken away, and so it proved;
for on hearing they had put it off until they saw me, I felt easy to pass on.

"`24th.--We got into Oxford about four o'clock,
and being unable to procure the town hall for a meeting, or any place sufficiently large,
felt easy to go to High Wiccorab, where we arrived on the 25th.

"`26th, first-day.--Attended meeting and it was a refreshing time of encouragement.
I was glad once more to sit quietly for a season amongst a little company of Friends;
after which, both Mary Pryor and I had religious communication,
and considerable brokenness appeared.

"`29th.--Went to a meeting held in the town hall at Aylesbury,
which was pretty much filled up with people of several descriptions:
Mary Pryor opened the service in a short testimony,
which had a tendency to quiet the meeting,
and I thought it right to avail myself of the opportunity,
before any unsettlement again took place;
so I stood up in a state of weakness with the words of the most High through the prophet,
'Behold I will send for many fishers, says the Lord, and they shall fish them;
and I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them,
from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.'
It was a very laborious, trying time,
and I did not feel that relief and comfort which I have done in some that are over;
however, there were, I hope, some tender minds;
in the fore part of my testimony I was led to open the state of a true
gospel minister and I heard afterward that several priests were present.
After dinner we rode to Amefsham,
which was a mournful ride to me--the land lies open and
dreary in these parts and without fences,
so also are the minds of many of the people.

"`30th.--Feeling no opening this morning to appoint a public meeting,
I attended the week-day meeting, which was a quiet comfortable time,
and I hope I was in the way of my duty: after dinner went to Uxbridge,
accompanied by William Hull.
I have felt myself little and solitary today.
My labours since leaving this place several months ago,
though they were heavy in the north, yet yielded me peace;
and now they appear like a dream.
O what sorrowful moments, may I not say hours, have I passed at Uxbridge,
and now am again here, a poor, helpless servant;
unless my Master is pleased again to give forth the word of command,
and freshly anoint and appoint me to his service.
I desire to trust in the Lord, who has been my helper hitherto,
and endeavour to do my allotted duty,
that so I may be favoured to dwell in the land of spiritual life,
and be fed with food convenient for me.
It has been a dull time with me of late--what next--and where next?
is the language of my soul.
Is a further baptism necessary to fit me for further labour?
O the mystery of that way in which a true gospel minister is led and fed.
I hope that at least I desire to be still rightly led about and instructed.

"`Twelfth month 3rd, first-day.--To meeting in very great strippedness and poverty;
and got some relief by unfolding some of my prospects in a close line.

From a letter received from his friend David Brooks, of North Carolina,
dated twelfth month, 1797, to whom he looked up as a father in the truth,
the following extracts are taken:

"`I received your cordial letter, dated first month 31st,
1797,--I had then obtained a certificate to come northward,
and was just coming out of the furnace.
I am now at Baltimore, and there appearing a favourable conveyance,
I felt free to inform you, that through mercy I am yet in the body,
and moving about in the exercise of my small gift.
This town has lately been visited +++[+++with the yellow fever]
by Him who remains to be terrible in judgment as well as glorious in holiness,
and fearful in praises.
I meet with a remnant in my passing up and down, with whom I have sweet fellowship,
and sometimes can join them in weeping, as between the porch and the altar,
under a painful sense of the poor, languishing state of the church, with a mental prayer,
that the Lord may yet pity his people and spare his heritage.
I am often led down into suffering with the pure seed which lies under oppression,
and have to speak a word of comfort to the mourners.
Dear Charity Cook, I expect is by this time on that island, +++[+++Great Britain]
and if you meet her remember my kind love to her,
and let her know she has had my sympathy.

Dear friend, the length of time, and the distance of the way we are separated,
only serves to strengthen the bond of gospel love, in a measure of which I salute you,
with desires that we may always wait at wisdom's gate to feel the fire burn,
and the offering prepared and sanctified:
for the main-spring that moves every thing into action
which meets with the approbation of the great Shepherd,
who bled for the flock, is in many places very low and weak;
and we well know that nothing but the genuine product
of his own spirit can ever promote his glorious cause,
in which I trust we have embarked.
Many in our land remember you with great sweetness.
Your letter was seasonable and comforting to me,
coming at a time when I was ready to cry out in
the bitterness of my spirit as Elisha did,
when he returned from following his master, who was taken up in the chariot of fire,
and smote the water with the mantle and cried out, 'Where is the Lord God of Elijah?'
Where is that power which cut Rahab and wounded the dragon,
and caused the prophet Habakkuk to tremble, and his lips to quiver?
Glory be to Israel's King forever,
our trials are often sanctified to our growth and experience in the truth:
farewell--approve yourself to be a workman in the holy building,
that needs not to be ashamed.

"`4th.--I felt easy to go to Tottenham this morning, and found Thomas Horne better.
In the evening a religious opportunity occurred in his sick chamber,
in which it seemed to me his removal would not be sudden,
and I thought there was yet some further work for him to do, which I expressed.

"`6th.--This morning I could not help giving vent to my tears,
both in my chamber and after coming down stairs, and got a little relief.
These things appear too mighty for me;
and really I fear sinking into such a low spot as to
think too little of past labours and services;
for surely I must have been helped with a little help from on high,
to go through what has been my lot of late months.
O, I could fall prostrate and say, Lord forgive,
sanctify and help me over my difficulties.
'Surely it is right to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement,
I will not offend any more.'
'That which I see not, teach me, and if I have done iniquity I will do so no more.'
But ah! who can adopt the last expressions?
it is the Lord alone who can enable any to do it.

"`7th.--Went to the monthly meeting at Tottenham,
and to my admiration I felt an opening to religious communication.
The meeting for business was truly a very distressing one; duty neglected brings poverty,
and what is worse, death.
I hope I laboured honestly.

"`8th.--A wakeful and thoughtful night, and I scattered my tears this morning:
when I look on the right and left, and forward,
it seems as if both Friends and the people at large,
are wrapped in a thick cloud that I cannot come at them, as to any religious service,
and the weight of oppression that lays upon me is great.
I endeavour to be cheerful at times, and do not show much of my feelings to others,
and yet am ready often to say, what shall I do?
'I am oppressed; I am distressed; O Lord leave me not,
but condescend to wash and cleanse, and undertake for me.'
'Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my supplication.
Attend unto me and hear me--I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise,
because of the voice of the enemy; because of the oppression of the wicked:
for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me;
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.'

"`9th.--Took a lonely walk after breakfast,
and on hearing that the vicar of Tottenham is ill,
I could not be easy without calling to see him.
His wife came down stairs, and was much agitated and affected.
I told her that hearing of her husband's illness, I felt love towards him,
and could not be easy without calling in, and wished to see him, if it was agreeable.
She went up, and after awhile returned, and excused my seeing him at this time,
but wished me to call tomorrow'. I told her I felt a motion of love in my heart,
and found it right to attend to such intimations,
and if I felt the same concern I should call again, and so came away.
I felt a degree of sweetness attending this manifestation of duty, although in the cross:
on returning I met Joseph Bevan and Richard Chester,
the latter I informed of a prospect that had been at times on my mind to go to Hartford,
and have a public meeting; and that I thought of going tomorrow.

"`10th,
first-day.--How can I describe the pangs of exercise and conflict that I felt last night.
When I awoke I thought I would endeavour as much as
possible to forget and leave the things that are behind,
and felt a little more composed.
Went to meeting under exercise, much humbled,
and again had a very close and searching testimony to bear.
I was glad to feel the stirrings of life even in this trying way;
and afterwards prostrated in prayer for forgiveness of sins,
and for the blessing of preservation.
O that more in the meeting had felt as I did!
Before dinner I could not feel easy without offering
another visit to the parson near Thomas Horne's,
whom I went to see yesterday, and had not admittance, but now went up into his room,
and told him what was on my mind; he received the visit kindly, and I felt peace.
After dinner got to Hartford about five o'clock,
and got through the meeting there to satisfaction; and laid down more comfortable.

"`11th, second-day.--I hope I can say my soul was humbled on waking this morning,
and desirous of renewing my covenant with my God.
After a while company came in,
but I felt as though I could retire alone and prostrate myself,
rather than be in company.

"`12th.--A stormy, rainy morning, and my eyes are not open to see the way I am to go,
and have been labouring after contentment.
Through favour I have a more quiet mind.
O what a lesson to learn.
Your will be done.
It was the subject of my communication on first-day evening amongst the people,
and may I be favoured more and more to learn it myself;
then I humbly trust my bonds will break, and my chains be loosened in due time.
A number of Friends came and drank tea with us.
I sat with them in silent conflict and sorrow.
I was glad to retire,
and spent the remainder of the evening in reading William Penn's works,
which were sweet to my taste;
and had also some religious conversation with the son of this family.

"`13th.--'Who is so blind as your servant:' if I am one of these,
it is my duty surely to be content;
for what greater honour can be paid to a master
than submitting to his will in all dispensations.
Went to the week-day meeting, where I begged for condescending mercy,
that all my giving way, or flinching in my trials, even in thought, might be forgiven;
and when it appeared nearly time to break up,
I feared to leave the meeting without telling them that
my soul had been let down into the deeps,
and that I had seen a time when husband would have to take leave of wife,
and wife of husband; a time such as that spoken of formerly,
'Rachel weeping for her children,
and would not be comforted because they were not;' and I
called on the youth to renew their covenants with the Lord.
I remembered also, and told them, what an enlarged, open time it was to me,
the first meeting I was at in this place,
and that I did believe there was then present a precious seed,
that the good Master saw fit should be visited; and now had to call some to mourning,
as the true way to a state of rejoicing.

"`When I sat down it appeared as if a little shower or cloud had emptied itself;
so much tenderness appeared.
I hope some were baptized, and I left the meeting more lightsome and easy.
Dined at Robert Manners'; and the way seemed to open to move on to Chelmsford.
O the very deep plunge my poor soul had there when visiting Essex,
and I think it is the only place where I had not a public meeting;
but I sat the meetings on first-day morning and afternoon in silence.
O Lord,
may I still entertain a hope that it is your wisdom and
power that is leading me about and instructing me;
my soul craves ability to look up to you,
and if you ordain yet greater trials of my faith and patience,
grant your servant strength to say.
Your will be done.

"`14th fifth-day.--Set off early this morning,
accompanied by M. Phillips and James Brown, to Chelmsford.
Went round by Waltham Abbey and Epping, and found the waters very high;
passed by one house on the way to Epping surrounded by water.
Reached Chelmsford between three and four o'clock,
where we stopped at Robert Greenwood's, and I desired Friends to be sent for;
several came, and I told them my wish to have a meeting in the morning at ten o'clock,
to which they made objections, saying it was market day.
After night, several country Friends came in, with some others,
and began to talk again about the meeting, which I found they had not begun to invite to,
except one young man, who willingly engaged in it,
and had rode seven miles out and back to inform a family.
I was told that it was not likely the people would come,
and there was a fear that Friends would not,
but if I was not easy to have a meeting after market, in the afternoon, they would try,
but the neighbours were not very free to come, etc.
This cast a damp on my prospect,
and after sitting some time in silent thought and conflict,
I told them the prospect had left me, and I must wait until morning, and so we broke up.

"`15th, sixth-day.--After breakfast I felt easy to move on,
and got to the ferry opposite Gravesend, twenty-three miles, about three o'clock,
but could not get over until night, and then rode seven miles to Rochester.
Lodged at Dr. Cowper's, who with his wife and sister received us kindly.

"`16th.--Yesterday I had thoughts of going to some further meetings, but now it closed up.

"`17th, first-day.--Sat both meetings in silent conflict.
In the evening went to William Rickman's and drank tea,--soon after which I
felt a little to communicate to a state among the youth present,
as I apprehended, and while I was trying to get the little company still, others came in,
and had like to have prevented me; however, I measurably relieved my mind,
and then went into the school room, and had a pretty full time with the boys.
I ventured also to kneel down and pray for the raising up and sending forth of labourers,
even from amongst them, to lands afar off,
afterwards had a comfortable time with a few young people.

"`19th.--Went to William Rick man's and spent some time;
after which took a walk for health.
I also went to see several persons, and at some of the places had religious opportunities.
In the evening my mind became exercised to speak to the company,
and I was much turned towards the doctor's assistant, a gay,
but apparently a goodly young man.

"`20th.--Very stripped and poor,
and I have need to exercise the little faith and patience left.
I dined at home, and took a lonely walk along the river.
O the oppression and death that I felt.

"`21st.---I concluded to set off this morning for London;
when I drew near and was entering it,
language fails to express the pangs of my travailing soul.
'Who shall dwell with devouring fire?
Who shall dwell with everlasting burning?'
I remembered what the royal Psalmist says; 'You wilt not leave my soul in hell.'
And at times of late I have been ready to query in myself,
is there such a thing possible as to live without faith and without hope?
Surely when the latter is deferred it makes the heart sick.
Shall I ever more be favoured to witness the annexed part,
'When the desire comes it is as a tree of life.'
I seem as if I knew not what to ask for, without it is patience to bear all,
and yet to hope all things.
O may a poor, tried creature say,
will it not be better to lay down the life of this body,
for many spiritual deaths have been my portion,
than to live to dishonour the noble and eternal truth of God, which my soul has espoused.
Lord, do according to your wisdom and mercy;
and O that you would be pleased to enable me to finish your work,
and if more suffering be allotted, that it may be for the seed's sake;
and preserve your servant, O God.

"`24th.--Went to the burial of Foster Reynolds,
and I do not remember when I felt more free from this load of oppression and death,
that has so much pressed upon me, than on the road this morning.
I felt a living motion in the meeting, and rejoiced in it,
to minister in a very close manner; and after George Dillwyn had also been engaged,
I bent in supplication.
After dinner had a singular, and I trust,
profitable opportunity with the children and other relations at the house of the widow.
Some sweetness has been infused in my bitter cup,
and I receive it with gratitude and thankfulness, at my Lord and Master's hand,
and beg for becoming patience to bear all things, and hope all things in time to come.
I feel an awful calm and solemnity now in being alone.
O sweet resignation! what a favour to receive the counsel of God.

"`25th.--Rode to London with Thomas Shillitoe,
and got there in time to attend the select quarterly meeting.
I felt a sweet calm and composure on the way,
and was very closely exercised in the meeting; and yet cannot say I felt fully relieved,
although pretty comfortable.
Went home with my kind friends, John and Tabitha Bevan,
and after dinner had an encouraging, open time in communication,
especially to the children.
O how desirable to be guided in the midst of the paths of judgment and truth.
I have my fears, and may they beget a care, and preserve in it.

"`26th.--To the quarterly meeting,
and both in the first and second meetings I had close and searching things to deliver.
O my Lord and Master, you favoured me a few evenings ago with a precious calm,
and the opening of vision again, in which moment my soul reverenced your name;
and you gave me boldness and assurance to plead your cause once more this day,
giving me to see you had not forsaken me, in which my soul rejoiced.
O continue the blessing of preservation, and open the way further to labour in this land,
if it be your will, that I may experience peace in the end.
My beloved friend Susanna Horne came into the men's meeting and spread a concern
before us to have a meeting appointed for the youth tomorrow at ten o'clock,
which was united with, and afterwards prayed for us; the Lord answer the petition.

"`27th.--On awaking, and before leaving my chamber,
my prayer was for preservation and help this day.
Went to the youths' meeting, which was large,
and the Friend who was concerned to appoint it, was largely opened for a strippling,
and favoured, I trust,
with sweet peace in an honest discharge of duty--a share also fell on me,
with a few expressions also from several of the youth,
and I hope and trust it was a solid, instructive time.
If it is your blessed will, O Lord, again to exercise your servant,
gird him about with strength sufficient for the day;
for you have enabled me to set up my Ebenezer once more this day, in a public manner.

"`28th.--This morning a prospect of duty was renewed to
hold a public meeting in the evening at Westminster.
I went, accompanied by Joseph Smith, and sat with them in their week-day meeting:
George Dillwyn and Sarah Fairbank were there,
and it was a season of encouragement to the weary travellers.
The meeting in Westminster meeting house was large, and I thought but a low,
laborious time;
I could not be easy without inviting the people to come
and set with us on first-day morning next.

"`29th.--To Clerkenwell meeting for the school children.
Here, as often before, I felt openness and some enlargement,
and hope my confidence was renewed,
and also a willingness to trust my divine Master in the future stoppings along in life,
to dispense whatever may be consistent with his will and pleasure;
if I may but be accounted worthy rightly to suffer,
and with humility and fear to rejoice.
Appointed a meeting to be held here this evening.
Went and dined with Joseph Savory's daughters, and believe I was in my place,
having a tendering, and I hope, an instructive time with them.
A large meeting at six o'clock, and it was an exercising, laborious time,
but Friends thought truth gained the victory; the people were quiet at the close,
and departed so.

"`31st, first-day.--I am going to Westminster meeting,
having invited the people to come and sit with me.
O for sustaining help to part with my own will, and be given up to the divine disposal.
The meeting was pretty large, and a solid time; and I invited them to come again,
not to hear preaching, for I told them I could not do that;
but such as were free to come at six o'clock in the evening, it would be pleasant to see.
Dined at Ann Fothergill's, and afterwards had a religious opportunity.
The meeting was held long in silence, and was thought to be a solemn one;
and towards the close, a time of instruction in religious communication,
and the people departed very quietly and solid.

"`1798, first month 1st, second day.--Had a refreshing night's sleep,
and feel a quiet mind this morning, though nothing presents as a religious requiring.
Here is the beginning of another year; and O if my life is preserved through it,
that it may be spent to the honour and glory of my heavenly Master, Christ Jesus my Lord.
Came to Joseph Smith's and heard that John Wright yesterday fell from his horse dead.
He was at the burial of Foster Reynolds last first-day week,
where I had to sound a solemn warning to prepare for death,
and in a particular manner to the aged.

"`3rd.--Went to Grace-church street meeting low and poor,
but had an arousing testimony to bear to some, and encouragement to hand to others.

"`4th.--Feeling a desire to go to Ratcliff, I gave up to it,
and dear Joseph Smith went with me.
I dropped my tears in exercise, not only on my own account, but for others,
and bent in supplication, and afterwards my line of communication was singular.
O gracious Lord fulfill your purposes in your own way and time,
and keep your servant from falling or letting go
his faith in your all-sufficient power and love.
Returned home and spent part of the evening in reading
Catherine (Payton) Phillips' journal to my kind landlady,
and feel rather lightened of my burden.

"`5th, sixth-day.--Attended the meeting for sufferings,
and it was evident that earthly wisdom 'prevailed; may it not be exalted over heavenly:
and yet in the midst, my mind for a small space was favoured with a comfortable calm,
and I saw that a purging time must and would overtake this part of the family.
O how my soul longs, and has done so before in this city,
that ancient simplicity and solidity might be restored.

"`6th.--My prospects of public meetings closed with the last on first-day evening;
and it is some encouragement to find that the
labour in that was not as water spilt on a stone.
A man who sat in the gallery, and for a time was noisy and unruly, went away thoughtful.
He had been a great swearer, but has not been heard to use an oath since,
fn the beginning of the meeting two other men were light and airy, talking, etc.,
but before it closed tears flowed from one of them,
and others expressed their satisfaction with the meeting,
and admiration at the long solemn silence.
The works of the Lord are indeed wonderful and hidden;--Lord,
condescend to continue to be the keeper of your servant, and open the way,
in your way and time, and grant me patience to wait for it.

"`7th, first-day.-- I felt very poor and empty on getting up this morning,
but hope I was favoured with a right qualification of mind to beg for help;
'Give us this day our daily bread.'
Attended Devonshire house meeting, accompanied by Joseph Smith, which was an open time,
and I requested Friends to invite their neighbours.
A number came in the afternoon, and I had another open opportunity,
and appointed a meeting for strangers on third-day evening at six o'clock.

"`9th.--I went to Devonshire house weekday meeting, which was a favoured time.
In the evening at six o'clock, attended a large meeting of other societies held there;
the house was full, or nearly so, and I got through to my own peace and satisfaction.
Mary Stacey and Margaret Allen, were fellow labourers with me.

"`10th.--I went this morning to Peel meeting, and it was a sweet,
contemplative season in silence, wherein my faith was renewed.

"`11th.--To Tottenham monthly meeting, held at Waltham Abbey,
where Ann Christy came with a minute to visit the families of Friends,
and Susanna Horne and Sarah Fairbank laid a concern to go into the counties of Kent,
Surry and Hampshire, which was united with.

"`12th.--Had a quiet and pretty comfortable time at the Peel meeting,
but nothing further presented with respect to public meetings.
I was in degree astonished on looking over the exercises I
have passed through in the course of one month:
'I will lead the blind by a way which they know not, and in paths they have not seen.'
Surely this has been my case--I endeavoured to pursue
my journey into some counties the other side of London,
but found I must turn back, and have been convinced of being in my place.
O for protection and help against the adversary,
and to stand prepared for further openings of duty.
The washing pool and furnace are necessary for such a poor thing as I am,
and I think I need them frequently.

"`14th, first-day.--I thought it right to go to the Peel meeting,
where I had a close testimony to deliver.
I thought I was a poor creature,
but these expressions impressed my mind soon after sitting down in meeting;
'Let us search and try our ways,' etc., and felt a willingness for mine to be so,
and endeavoured to examine my own account,
and before the meeting closed was engaged to put others in remembrance thereof,
believing that the accounts of some present were not in readiness,
either inwardly or outwardly, who were too much glued to the world;
and though they loved to hear words, yet it was not pleasant to be searched.
The afternoon meeting was nearly silent.

"`16th.--Went to Devonshire house meeting,
and soon after sitting down my mind became calm and comfortable.
I was concerned to labour in an encouraging line, to my own comfort,
and I hope that of others, particularly the youth.

"`17th.--I went to the Peel meeting, desirous to be in the way of duty,
and if anything should open towards inviting the people at large, I felt resigned.
It was silent, and my way closed up.

"`18th.--Went to Ratcliff, which was a small meeting,
and I had to persuade some to more faithfulness in little things.
Went to Thomas Horne's and dined, and had a serious opportunity with him and wife,
I hope and trust he is growing in the root under deep exercise.
O may he be kept under it the Lord's time, and may his companion give up to be his helper.

"`19th.--To meeting for sufferings.
I thought there was a sweetness and solemnity spread in the gathering,
and silent fore part; but it was not preserved and kept to.
I found a time near the close to relieve my mind,
and it opened a door for Joseph Gurney Bevan and George Dillwyn to do the same,
and we were favoured in the close; for which I was thankful.

"`21st, first-day.--To Devonshire house meeting,
which was pretty much crowded by many strangers, and proved an open enlarged opportunity;
several came and spoke tenderly and affectionately to me after meeting,
and one pretty finely dressed but goodly man, taking me by the hand, said;
'the Lord send forth more such preachers and prosper his work:' may it be so say I also,
for the praise belongs to him.
The afternoon meeting was put off to three o'clock--many people came again,
and much labour fell on me, to the spending of my strength and voice.
In the evening I was informed that dear Mary Horne died about two o'clock.

"`22nd.--A pretty comfortable night's sleep; and on waking,
my thoughts were soon turned to my afflicted Tottenham friends,
and hearing of an opportunity to go and see them, I embraced it;
nothing opening in London, I have concluded to stay,
my voice being much gone by yesterday's exertions in part,
and with the remains of a cold.

"`23rd.--Had a wakeful tossing night;
doubts and fears accompanying my weakness and infirmities,
and I feared some of them prevailed too much, for which I was much abased.
Had an opportunity with the surviving parent and all the children after dinner,
but in much weakness, and I could hardly speak.

"`24th.--Tears were my food this morning on rising from my bed, with strong cries;
clouds of distress gather about me,
and nothing short of omnipotent help can preserve me to the end.
O how empty and poor I feel yes, such was my exercise,
that I was ready to look on myself as vile,
and yet I may not reproach or reflect on my Divine Master.
Silence, then, you troubling thoughts, and may my soul possess a calm,
more so than has frequently of late been experienced,
and be found yet a learner in the school of Christ, which only fits for gospel ministry.
I spent a part of this evening in reading a work,
wherein I found this remark on a passage of scripture, that took my attention;
'Then did they spit in his face and buffeted him;
and others smote him with the palms of their hands:' Matthew 26:67.
This is incontestable truth;
he who is now sitting at the right hand of God; he whom all the angels adore;
he who could say, 'behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea,
I make the rivers a wilderness;... I clothe the heavens with blackness,
and I make sackcloth their covering,' Isaiah 1:3-4,
fulfills the words of an ancient prophecy; 'I gave my back to the smiters,
and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair:
I hid not my face from shame and spitting.'
'He whose name is unutterable, allowed himself to be ill-treated,
in the most shameful agonizing and disgusting manner, by the meanest wretches,
and he was silent: no ray of his omnipotence struck his creatures dead.
He concealed the power which created worlds.
What feelings suffice to adore in a proper manner the greatness of that divine virtue.'
I admire at the way in which I go shut up here from day to day.
My voice is much gone in consequence of a cold, and exertion of late in speaking.
When I examine and look back,
I cannot find that my mind has shrunk or turned away from revealed duty,
and yet what fears and cares accompany me lest
the truth should be evilly spoken of by my means.
This family is in a state of mourning,
and I am comforted and instructed in seeing and feeling such quiet,
and such tenderness manifested to the surviving parent, who is preserved calm,
and I hope resigned to his allotment.
O may the Lord prepare to open the way for me a poor servant,
and grant me a sufficient portion of faith and
patience to endure what may yet be to come.

"`25th.--My cold and sore throat are better,
and I feel measurably resigned to my present state;
nothing opens but to attend week-day meeting here to day,
and wait to accompany the remains of my friend to the meeting on first-day next.
In her life time she owned me for a child,
and as a mother sympathized with me under my trials, and her memory is precious.
O that all her children may walk in the truth,
and in the end of time close their days in peace.

"`26th.--I spent my time to day in extracting some parts of holy scripture.
Afterwards walked in the garden for health and meditation;
I thought if there is nothing in such stops as this,
surely then my faith and hope in the divine arm are vain: I cannot, I dare not,
give up to believe so.
O then grant me patience, with all other necessary virtues to endure; for you only,
O Lord, can turn my wilderness into a fruitful field at your pleasure.

"`27th.--One word dropped last evening was an affliction to me.
If for every idle word which man shall speak he must give an account,
how awful is the reckoning.
O that I could arrive at a more fixed habit of righteousness and purity of heart;
for blessed are such, they shall enjoy greater union and communion with God.
What are words or such memorandums as these, but as mementos to look back at.
They are made in much simplicity, sometimes, it may be frequently,
not remembering what passed yesterday, or not looking back to ascertain.
I desire to be more industrious,
and improve the time in these stops from travelling and ministerial labour.
Singular indeed have been the stops and stays I have experienced in this land,
and even in this house.
O Lord, break or loosen the chain that has held me; not in my time and will,
but in yours; and preserve my poor soul from sinking under the temptations,
conflicts and trials that have so long been permitted to assail.
O Fountain of mercy and life,
did you not enable your servant when leaving that comfortable dwelling you afford me,
parent, wife and children, and all,
to follow you whithersoever you might be pleased to lead,
and into what you might be pleased to appoint--O then forsake me not.

"`28th, first-day.--I rose with more calmness than some times of late.
After breakfast walked the garden until some of the relations came to attend the burial;
I followed the remains of the deceased to Tottenham meeting,
where my mind was exercised and impressed with weight which soon ripened into duty,
after sitting down amongst a large company.

The language of our Saviour to those who did not understand what the
woman was doing in anointing his head with the precious ointment,
was presented as the subject to begin with, namely; 'Why do you trouble the woman,
for she has wrought a good work upon me.
For in that she poured the ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.'
What a small service is acceptable when performed in sincerity,
though at the same time with a trembling hand and heart.
I saw no opening after meeting to go to the ground in Southwark, but returned home,
where I found the husband and daughter Martha.

"`29th.--A great favour I thought to feel so quiet and
such a degree of renewed comfort extended;
my mind was gathered into a calm this morning.
I record it as a favour thus to feel,
and yet do I not fall short of that resignation which receives all
dispensations with becoming cheerfulness at the hand of the Lord.
O, I hope, I trust, my soul has been secretly supported above murmuring or repining,
though it is trying to walk in darkness and see but little light.
Praise the Lord, O my soul, through all, and forget not the benefits bestowed.
As I walked the garden after breakfast,
a prospect was renewed which had fastened on my
mind in a time of prostration in my chamber,
namely,
to join company with those females (Susanna Horne and Sarah
Fairbank) and begin where they left off some weeks ago,
and lay the prospect before John Bevans to accompany me.
My heart leaped for joy within me in the prospect of a way opening into further labour,
because he that labours, or reaps,
receives wages and gathers fruit unto everlasting life.
May my soul delight in doing the Lord's work so long as strength and faculties permit,
and until the great Lord of the harvest may be pleased to say it is enough.

"`30th.--The same prospect opened as yesterday morning on rising,
and I left my chamber more cheerful.
My soul craves preservation through all, and that I may not be permitted to mar the work.
Went to town, and on going to Devonshire house meeting, found my friend and neighbour,
William Savery, there.
It was a silent meeting--went with him to Joseph Savory's and dined.

"`31st.--To Grace-church street meeting; dear George Dillwyn, I thought,
had a sweet time, and I ventured to prostrate myself in prayer, and my faith was renewed.

"`Second month 1st.--Felt content at home,
when I received letters from my dear wife and mother.
They were of an old date, but enclosed in one from my son, dated first month 1st,
acceptable tokens of remembrance.
In the afternoon accompanied by Joseph Smith, went to the burial of the widow Perry,
and had to hand forth a little in much weakness.

"`4th, first-day.--Went to Grace-church street meeting,
and again was exercised in a very close testimony to the great and gay, etc.;
after afternoon meeting, in which I was silent, went to a burial in Bunhill Fields,
and felt an exercise while standing at the grave to address the children,
a number of whom were there.

"`5th.--Much exercised this morning whether to go with George Dillwyn to Chelmsford,
etc.,
or move on towards Rochester with Susanna Horne and Sarah Fairbank After a
time of conflict and going through a little piece of mortifying service,
though there was but little time to get ready,
yet by setting about it in earnest I soon accomplished it,
and set off about two o'clock with them and William Forster,
and got into Rochester between nine and ten o'clock, a distance of thirty miles.
I put up at my old quarters, Dr. Cowper's, and the women at William Rickman's;
still under much exercise and depression of mind.

"`6th.--Attended the monthly meeting,
and my two friends I thought spoke to the state of the meeting,
and it was my lot again to sit in silent conflict,
but before the business was concluded I laboured amongst the men.

"`7th.--Our women inclining to goto the week-day meeting at Canterbury,
and two chaises being provided, I drove one and Richard Weston the other;
we had a very fine warm day, and got to William Elgar's a little after night,
and were kindly received.

"`8th.--Was favoured with a degree of sweet calm in the morning before I rose.
Attended the week-day meeting, which was very small,
and I laboured among them in poverty as well as I could.
Sarah Fairbank had a short testimony, and Susanna Horne closed in prayer.
I hope it was a meeting to some profit, or may prove so in days to come,
if the fault is not their own; returned to our quarters and dined.

"`9th.---Rode back to Rochester twenty-six miles,
and soon after arriving John Bevans came, in order to accompany me.
In the evening dropped into silence, in which I ventured to labour amongst the company,
and in particular, was turned toward a young married couple.
Ah! how very poor and stripped I feel of later days,
and admire that any good thing should arise out of it.

"`11th.--Sat the morning meeting silent; my two sisters laboured in a close manner,
but I sat in usual poverty.
Dined at William Cooper's, and afterwards we all stepped in to see T. White and daughter,
and my mind was so clothed with sympathy as not to be easy without expressing it.
Soon after I sat down in the afternoon meeting, a thought impressed me,
that perhaps I might soon be enabled to relieve my mind amongst Friends,
and then desire them to go to the dock yard and invite the people there,
and others to come; but I had to conflict with my exercise a considerable time.
O how my own infirmity came up and stared me in the face,
and it was hard work to get at anything.
At last I ventured to labour, and that in a close line for the most part,
with some encouragement to the visited ones; and also with the children:
this meeting held late.
Drank tea at R. Horsnail, Jr.'s, and afterwards went to the school,
where I had some communication to the boys; but that which gave me most ease of mind,
was what I had afterwards to say to the female servants in the family,
who came and sat with us,
together with a tender young person who keeps shop for William Horsnail.
O Lord, if it is your will that I should go on further,
be pleased to accompany me and bear up my mind,
and preserve it subjectly given up to your will, through what is yet to be met with.
O that of living without carefulness, as the lilies of the field grow,
and to depend on Him who feeds the ravens: what greater blessing!
I sometimes endeavour to encourage others so to do,
and yet how poor and feeble in my own particular.

"`12th.--Set off about seven o'clock, and put up at William Marsh's at Folkstone,
soon after which, came in Joseph Elgar, his sister, and several others,
with whom I had a religious opportunity,--pretty open.

"`13th.--To the monthly meeting, in which my mind was opened and enlarged in testimony,
and found work also in the business part, I hope to some profit.
In the evening had one for the neighbourhood, which was largely attended;
and after sitting about two hours in silence,
I stood up in weakness and poverty and laboured amongst them.

"`14th.--Friends were so kind as to send us to Dover in a post chaise.
After dining at Richard Baker's,
a number of us took a walk along the sea shore as far as the castle, etc.
I feel poor and oppressed, although I am in a sweet family and comfortable as to them.
How often is this language uppermost, and is it not necessary for me:
'Wash me in the laver of regeneration.'

"`15th.--I have a pleasant lodging room next the sea,
and some serious reflections impressed my mind this morning.
I remembered what S. C. says concerning outward defence and armies;
and on mentioning it to my host, he told me he often thought of it.
Went to meeting, and I sat in silence nearly or quite two hours; my female friends,
Richard Baker and daughter Mary, with William Rickman, all had communications;
and at last I stood up with a few expressions, comparing myself to Obadiah,
who fed the Lord's prophets in a cave,
and my condition seems like going into a cave to visit the honest seed which lies hid.
My mind was pretty much opened and enlarged, and the meeting was in a comfortable,
solid state, and I hope ended so.
Dined at Richard Baker's, and felt poorly after dinner.
O that I may be preserved worthy to have the divine will accomplished in and by me,
in what may yet be to come.
My way home in the right time, is what my soul seeks and craves at the divine hand,
as has in mercy been granted in former journeys in the land of my nativity.`"

The following is an extract from a letter to his wife, dated;

Dover, Second month 16th, 1798.

My dear,

The sympathetic feelings expressed in your last letter were comfortable,
and there is yet reason to continue them,
as my path still differs from most of my fellow labourers in this land.
I went as far north as I could see my way with clearness, and it was admirable to me,
that in attending the two quarterly meetings at Kendal and Cockermouth,
I felt such enlargement of heart,
that it appeared pretty clear to me I should not
be required to visit all the particular meetings;
and so it turned out.
After those meetings were over I felt quite easy
to go towards London and its neighbourhood;
and with thankfulness I may acknowledge, my way was made prosperous,
and in some places I experienced much enlargement;
but on approaching the before mentioned place,
I thought it seemed like going down again into suffering; and may I not add, into death.
My last letter, by Mary Pryor, was written at her house.
She was in London waiting to embark; and while there I experienced a season which,
amongst many others passed through, is worthy to be remembered.
From there I passed into Essex, to Chelmsford, thinking to have a meeting there,
it being the only place in that county where I omitted
having a public meeting when I visited Friends;
and here again I missed my aim, and felt easy to move on without it for the present,
a little circumstance turning up that put it by.
We crossed over the river Thames at Gravesend, and rode after night to Rochester,
about seven miles, and about thirty from London,
and put up at William Cowper's. I had thoughts
of going on to the further end of this county,
to places I have lately been at, but my way closed up.
I was in a low, exercised state, and remained over their first-day meetings,
and until the middle of the week following,--silent in the meetings, and shut up.
At length way opened to go back to the great city,
into which I entered under a load of conflict,
but was kindly received by my dear friends Joseph and Rachel Smith.
Here I spent several days, and hearing of the burial of Foster Reynolds,
about ten miles out of London, my way opened to attend it.
The corpse was taken into the meeting-house, and after being shut up,
in meeting after meeting, for several days,
I was favoured with what I thought rather a powerful opening,
to reason with some as Paul did with Felix;
and afterwards obtained much relief in an opportunity in the family of the deceased,
and felt very calm, with much sweetness of mind in the evening.

A few days after came on the quarterly meeting for London,
which I felt my mind pressed to attend, and trust I was in my place.
Since then I have been carefully feeling my way to appoint public meetings in London,
a service which never opened before; and in several places I have been helped through,
I trust, so as not to dishonour the cause.
You wilt find by mine by Mary Pryor, that I had been spending some days at Tottenham,
my kind friend Thomas Horne having been, in the apprehension of the family,
near death's door.
I found him on the recovery, and indeed I did believe he would be restored to his family,
and told them my thoughts, but with respect to his dear, weakly wife, it was hid from me.
She appeared uncommonly well during his illness, and after that flagged and failed,
and slipped away almost unexpectedly from them,
but I trust as a shock of corn fully ripe.
She was a sympathizer with me in my exercises, and I loved her;
and it fell to my lot to be at her burial, first month 28th.

I had this prospect of visiting Kent, etc., when at Sheffield,
and have made the second attempt to do so.
I am now in company with Susanna Horne and Sarah Fairbank,
who had mentioned their prospect to the monthly meeting,
of going this journey into the counties of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire,
before the decease of Mary Horne.
We have been to several meetings together;
and whether I shall go any further than through this county,
and then return back to London, I cannot see at present.
Things are very low in some places, and my mind is low also,
and I have been comparing my state to that of Obadiah,
whose work was to feed the prophets in the cave.
It is trying work to go as into the earth, and into caves and rocks,
but I labour after a qualification daily to say, 'Your will, and not mine be done.'
I have John Bevans, the Friend at whose house I made my home last winter in London,
when visiting families, as a companion, who is a valuable elder of Peel meeting.
I am now at Richard Baker's at Dover,
and while taking a walk before breakfast this morning along the sea coast,
I could see the French shore, and my mind was pretty strongly turned towards home,
but there is a great sea between us, and so I must try to bound my thoughts,
and bear with patience the painful conflicts that will arise.
O that it may be with becoming patience, considering that if it is the Lord's will,
he can as safely conduct me back, as he brought me here;
whose will is our sanctification,
and unto whose almighty protection and help I am desirous of commending you,
my dear wife, my aged mother, children, relations and friends,
who am your exercised and often tried husband,

Thomas Scattergood.

"`17th.--I felt in a low state this morning, and saw no opening to move this day.
We dined at Deborah Beck's, and had a religious opportunity,
in which I had various things to express to different states, from the aged grandmother,
to the grandchild, and was also turned rather particularly to an apprentice.
I felt some liberty last evening and this morning,
to give some account of my travels in America, with a degree of cheerfulness attending;
and I think dear Richard Baker is considerably raised out of a very low state,
in which we found him.
Saw this afternoon a fleet of upwards of one hundred vessels off the harbour,
going down the channel.

"`18th, first-day.--Bonds and afflictions still continue to await me.
I heard yesterday that my friend and brother William Savery is
likely to go for Liverpool in less than two weeks,
in order to embark for home.
I see no opening, and very little ahead in this land,
so after endeavouring to lift up my soul in prayer to God,
not to be forsaken in the midst of the trials and temptations I have to conflict with,
and for ability to cast myself on the mighty Helper,
whose providence is extended over the whole earth, I arose under exercise; cast down,
but I hope not forsaken.
Went to the morning and afternoon meetings, and laboured in both,
as also did my fellow helpers:
spent the evening at home--a number of Friends
came in and we had a religious opportunity.
My companion told me that there was at meeting on fifth-day last,
a person who had been heard to say, that he could make Scripture;
and in the course of my communication I made use of the same expression,
signifying the possibility of getting into such a depraved state,
as to be bold enough not only to deny that good book, but even to speak in that way.
I had to labour to dissuade another from the spirit of war and fighting;
he was closely spoken to, and his condition opened.
Yesterday was a laborious one, and close work.

"`19th.--I have had close exercise in this place,
but my little room next the sea has been in degree like the prophet's room.
My body has been refreshed, and this morning my mind also, in good degree.
After breakfast Richard Baker had the two women and I apart,
and handed forth some seasonable advice to those young plants to encourage them;
and I had a good time on parting, mostly addressed to Richard's wife.
We stopped at Sandwich to dine, and arrived at Margate before night.

"`20th.--No way opened towards a meeting, so we visited all the members in their houses.

"`21st.--Felt so poorly this morning that I thought of lying in bed,
but I struggled along, and after breakfast we had a sitting,
in which I was engaged in a very close line, and again before we set off,
in an encouraging way to three of the widow Newby's children:
I felt great relief of mind.
The ride of seventeen miles to Canterbury was a sweet one to me.
O the works of the Lord are wonderful!
Last evening I admired that I could not relieve my mind in the widow's family,
and this morning several of the children were cast in my way.
So it was with regard to two other states, and they were also brought in my way.
When I met with J. Newby at the burial of Samuel Spavold, she was in much gaiety,
as her sisters now are, and now she appears to be an ornament to society;
and I hope her next sister is coming on in her footsteps.
Went to Ashford, fifteen miles, and arrived a little after night.

"`22nd.--There was but a small company at meeting: I stood up first,
and addressed some aged persons present,
with desires that they might be ready to give up their account when called for.
Susanna Horne had a good time, much in the same line,
and Sarah Fairbank was concerned in supplication.
Afterwards I requested that such as were not members would withdraw,
and had something for the younger class; and again desiring a further selection,
I got pretty fully relieved.
To the meeting this morning came T. F., about thirty years old,
who some time after the expiration of his apprenticeship entered into the army,
and was disowned by that meeting.
He was also with us in the evening,
and all of us were favoured to hand forth instructive remarks to him.
He put a letter into my hands this morning,
from which it appears that he is under great exercise of mind,
and says I was favoured to find him out in meeting and in the sitting afterwards.
My soul craves that he may be favoured rightly to get through his present conflict,
and in days to come make a valuable, useful member of society.
Yesterday and last evening I endeavoured to feel my way
respecting going into a neighbouring county,
remembering the exercise I passed through previous to entering this;
but as my divine Master has favoured with evidences of being right so far,
I felt encouraged to proceed into Sussex, and this day am pretty comfortable.

"`24th.--We set off between eight and nine o'clock, and a more stormy,
rainy ride I have not had, I think in this land: put up at Richard Rickman's, Lewes.
In the afternoon my prospects were more clouded,
but on the whole am pretty comfortable this evening.

"`25th,
first-day.--Went to meeting and found it was the
day on which they hold their preparative meeting,
and have no meeting in the afternoon.
I have been concerned about the practice of holding such meetings on first-day; however,
I thought it right to endeavour to see it out,
and as I felt nothing to communicate in the first,
I proposed that men and women should sit together,
and hear the queries read and answered,
as it was previous to quarterly and yearly meetings.
I sat pretty quietly until that concerning plainness, etc., came on:
the clerk made a modest answer,
but one or two whose appearance did not strike me pleasantly, even to the outward eye,
proposed that it should be more full, and say, generally careful.
I felt much on this occasion, and indeed before,
and had to query who there was amongst them that looked like Friends,
with more of a very close nature.

"`26th.--To breakfast with S. C. and had a sitting with her and two daughters;
both our female Friends had a pretty full opportunity,
and I had also to address one of them in a few words.
To S. R.'s, where Sarah Fairbank had most of the labour; after the opportunity was over,
she said she felt, comfortable, etc.;
which afforded me an opportunity to tell her that I wished it was otherwise;
for how could any rightly concerned Friend feel comfortable,
when the walls and gates of Zion were laid waste, as in this place.
To C. S.'s, where much ignorance and rawness appeared; but I was enjoined to be tender,
remembering the words of the Apostle, on some having compassion making a difference.
To J. R.'s, where we dined, and had an opportunity: the labour fell on my two friends.
O the stripped state I have been in today;
so mournful and heavy that I could have broken away
from my company and gone into the fields alone,
to pour out my soul.`"

In a letter addressed to his son, dated second month 27th, 1798, at Lewes, he says:

"`I am labouring along in much weakness, and perhaps I may safely add,
at seasons in fear and trembling.
Things are very low in some places, and I have to go down as into the grave;
yet in some others, there has been a happy resurrection into life, and sweet peace,
and my soul is thankful for the preservation experienced so far.
May you, my dear son, increase in the increases of your heavenly Father's love,
is the desire of your father,`"

"`28th.--Went to meeting, where I was shut up in silence.
Rode to Brighton to John Glaisyer's,--felt more comfortable on the road.
We had a sitting after supper, in which I had considerable to communicate,
and felt love to this family, and liberty and ease in it.
We walked to see the sea by moonlight, which was a very beautiful sight.
This town is situated on the bank near the sea.

"`Third month 1st.--We all took a walk before meeting along the sea-side.
It was a pensive and mournful one to me: at meeting all of us were silent.
Several Friends dined with us, after which I broke away and strolled along the sea coast.
O me, what a walk!
The Lord hid his face, and my soul was troubled.

"`2nd.--I am upwards of three thousand miles from my family,
and a wanderer in the fields, to seek relief,
by endeavouring to prostrate myself before the Lord.
I took a solitary walk before dinner, and felt no opening to go into the families,
or to appoint a meeting.
How am I wrapped about with darkness and sorrow,
and can have little delight in what many, it is to be feared, freely indulge in,
at this place so noted for pleasure.

"`3rd.--I omitted to mention that last even we sat in John Glaisyer's family;
he being in the practice of calling them together and sitting down with them,
two evenings in the week.
My companions had something to offer, and I was glad of such a quiet opportunity.

"`I arose this morning under exercise, and after breakfast set off,
accompanied by John Glaisyer and rode to Arundle, twenty miles:
put up at the widow Sarah Horne's. I laboured after resignation on the road,
having endeavoured to see and feel my way to this place before I set off.
May I be favoured to bear with patience the burden that continues on me,
until it be removed, for I do not see that I can remove it.
'All the days of my appointed time will I wait, until my change come.'
What could afflicted Job do better than to form such a resolution as this.
Soon after getting into this place, John Bevans and John Glaisyer and I,
took a walk along the river, and on our way home went into the castle gate.
This is the castle where Mary Penington's first husband was ill, when she went to him.
Soon after we got into the yard we met the owner, the duke of Norfolk,
who behaved very courteously, and bid his servant show us inside the house, etc.
I informed him where I came from, and he took me to see a stuffed moose,
which he said came from my country.

"`4th, first-day.--A night of labour and some pain.
I thought myself a poor creature on awaking,
having little or no prospect of being favoured
to do anything this day in a religious way;
however, endeavoured to wash and anoint.
It was the time of their holding both the meeting of ministers and elders,
and also the monthly meeting; the first began at nine o'clock,
and held until near eleven; the monthly meeting began at eleven, and held late.
There was some opening to labour in both;
in the fore part of the second meeting a number of town's people came in,
and after Sarah Fairbank had addressed her fellow professors,
I felt my mind drawn forth in love to the others;
and as she had mentioned the situation of Naaman, I believed it right to revive it again,
and hope to some profit.
They behaved solidly, and Friends were desired to stop, both men and women,
and I thought Susanna Horne had a good time amongst them.
John Bevans and I also laboured, I hope to some profit, in the business part,
and the meeting ended well.
Dined at Sarah Horne's with a considerable number of Friends,
and was favoured afterward with a conspicuously baptizing time.
This was cause of admiration to me,
who for days past have been so wrapped up as in a cloud.
O Brighton! shall I soon forget my feelings, my humbling, bitter feelings in you?

Went afterwards with the company to see Tryphena Halloway,
a widow near one hundred and two years of age.
She had just gone to bed, but we were admitted up to see her,
and I was glad to find so much sensibility,
and such a thankful heart for favours received.
It was to my admiration,
and a treat to me to sit by such a fellow pilgrim so far advanced in age.
It is said she well remembers William Penn.

"`5th.--Went to Chichester, accompanied by John Glaisyer,
where we attended the burial of Mary Heath, who lived in Friends' meetinghouse:
after the corpse was laid in the ground, Friends retired into the meeting-house,
and it was pretty much filled up with people of other societies.
Soon after we were gathered,
I thought there was a silence and degree of solemnity prevailed,
and Susanna Horne appeared in prayer,--Sarah Fairbank in a lively little testimony.
Afterwards much unsettlement appeared, and my mind was plunged very low,
perhaps in part on my own account, and partly for the people.
When we broke up the meeting,
with much feebleness I requested the little company of Friends to stop,
and I hope it proved a time of baptism.
We dined with James Hack, Sr., and after dinner my mind was again engaged to minister;
and I thought if it was a living bud or branch,
it sprang up suddenly out of the dry and barren ground.
This is a mystery; that I should at times feel, in my own apprehension,
so wretched and miserable, loaded with, or surrounded by temptation,
and yet be made instrumental to bring others into tears and tenderness.
Well, the Lord have the praise of his own work.

"`6th.--My heart is measurably thankful for sustaining help to carry me through,
and bear up my drooping mind over all the conflicts yet to be met with.
This one day more may bread sufficient to keep alive,
and a little portion of peace be my lot;
and O that the same may be the portion of all my companions in labour,
and that we may be safely directed in the work we are engaged in,
whether to go forward or back, whether to stay together or separate.
We went to see all the families in this place,
and my mind is more lifted up above my trials than I have experienced for some time past.
In some families we had pretty close labour.

"`7th.--Went to Brighton to the monthly meeting.
On the road I lagged behind, and had a quiet, thoughtful time.
It is the day appointed for a general fast, so called,
and for humiliation for the sins of the nation;
but to me it is a little like the lifting up of the head; I have had many fasting,
humbling seasons since coming into this land.

The just are to live by faith: O that I may yet be favoured to live by a measure thereof.
Very little pleasant bread have I eaten for three years and upwards,
and it is good to be content,
well knowing the Almighty can cause a change of feelings at his pleasure;
he can change the dispensation as a water course is turned in a field.
O for watchfulness and care in stepping along,
that the divine will may be done in and by me, a poor, unworthy servant.

"`We got into Brighton before night; put up at John Glaisyer's.

"`8th.--The monthly meeting was very small:
I counted about twelve men after the women left.
At the close I felt a little matter to arise, and stopped those who were going away;
it was staggering work, but a little increase of strength was given me,
and there appeared to be an increase of weight:
after I had closed Susanna Horne had a pretty good time.
Things are very low in this place, and we endeavoured to lend a helping hand.

"`9th.--Took a walk to the sea before breakfast and feel refreshed:
we proposed setting off for Horsham, but our friend Susanna Horne is poorly.
After breakfast felt so much love to spring up towards William Savery,
as to induce me to sit down and write to him.
Took another lonely walk along Brighton shore,
in which my thoughts were turned over the sea,
and my soul craves the continuation of the protecting power and providence of God.
Man knows not my tried state; and when I view it,
I am brought into a degree of trembling,
and were it not that the fountain of mercy remains open to wash in, I should fail;
but of late I have remembered the promise made me on setting
off on this journey as a little inward intimation.
The remainder of this day I thought but a broken one.
John Glaisyer sat down with his family in the evening,
and a number of neighbours came in, but to me there appeared neither dew nor rain.

"`10th.--We all set off accompanied by our kind friend John Glaisyer as guide,
to Horsham, twenty miles.
I seemed refreshed in my body with the ride, but it has been a dull time otherwise,
since making the above note on the sea shore.

"`11th,
first-day.--I fear that I let my tongue go too freely in conversation last evening,
considering my state.
What need of watchfulness, circumspection and care!
I hope my mind has been measurably prostrated this morning.
Ah!
I should faint and fall if the Lord helped me not secretly.
Dare I lift up mine eyes and soul to him?
O yes!
I must not, dare not, forbear doing so.
Attended both meetings, and sat them through in silence:
my companions laboured in the morning: I went in a low condition,
particularly in the morning, and found there was nothing for me to do.
I remembered my parting from my home, and my strippings since,
and I wet the floor with my tears.
Well, my soul desires to lay hold of the Lord's promise,
to be with and support my wife and bless my children--to help me,
even though it may be through the correction of his rod, in this land,
hoping and believing that the staff also will not fail in time of need.
Drank tea at W. D.'s, where my companions had close communication,
and I feared wholly to omit labouring also: came home and felt rather more easy.

"`13th.--From Horsham to Ifield, twelve miles; put up at W. T.'s, a baker;
both he and his wife are concerned Friends.

"`14th.--Walked to Ifield meeting; the select meeting began at nine o'clock,
and the monthly meeting at eleven.
I found some openness to labour in the first,
and also when I sat down in the large meeting-house,
my thoughts were turned to look back and remember the
state of society in the coming forth of Friends,
and afterwards, and I had to mention it.
It proved to my admiration a pretty open time.
We laboured honestly in the business part, and on the whole felt easy.

"`15th.--Set off about ten o'clock, after a sitting with the family where we lodged,
and arrived at Brighton before night, having rode twenty-seven miles.

"`16th.--Feel much recruited in strength this morning.
Our beloved Susanna Horne is poorly, and nursing her cold,
which she has been troubled with for some days past.
Here we are again at Brighton.
We sat with the family in the evening, and I was glad of having a little time of quiet.

"`17th.--I took a lonely walk along the sea shore,
and from there up a valley between the hills, and had a pensive, thoughtful time.
Humbled in examining my accounts, yet do not feel condemnation,
as though any religious service had been omitted.

"`18th, first-day.--Many Friends attended the meeting, and it was filled up with others:
my way closed up in silence, not of the pleasantest kind.
After dinner had an opportunity with some young people, which proved a tendering time.
Went to afternoon meeting at three o'clock,
and after sitting until I thought it was time to conclude,
looking over the meeting and seeing how thickly the people stood,
and with what patience and quiet some behaved, though others were light part of the time,
my heart yearned towards the goodly ones, and I was not easy without expressing a little,
which little made way for more, and I hope it was to profit.
The select meeting was held in the evening at seven o'clock.
This was a very searching time, and very close expressions escaped my lips.

"`19th.--To quarterly meeting, where many strangers attended;
in the early part Susanna Horne had some lively communication,
and I was ready to conclude it would have fallen on me to continue the labour,
but it died away.
Sometime after T. Summer stood up,
and after he had closed I wished Friends to go to the business,
for my mind seemed pressed down,
and I looked to get relief amongst them when more select, which I was favoured to do,
though in a very close way, both in the men's and women's meeting, and I trust,
towards the close the precious oil was felt to flow, and truth was measurably over all;
I was very much relieved, though weary.
Came home to dine,
and afterwards had several sweet opportunities with Friends who came in.
My female companions dined out, but came in to tea,
and we had a sitting with the family and others.
Dear Susanna Horne had a very enlarged time, and I felt an opening to follow:
in this season it was opened to me, that it was likely to be a parting opportunity to us,
though at times there has been some glimmering
prospect of going with them into Hampshire;
but now it looks likely they must try that county by themselves,
and perhaps way will be made for me to get relieved
from the people at large in Brighton--so be it.
This I mentioned apart to Susanna Horne,
and it is a comfort that her mind is prepared to receive it.

"`20th.--Set off this morning with the women Friends and stopped at Thomas Leadbeater's,
and had a sweet opportunity in his wife's sick room with her two daughters;
love flowed freely.
To W. G.'s and dined, and after I had got through my exercise in this convinced family,
we had a sweet parting season.
Soon after, the women set off for Chichester, and I returned to Brighton,
weary with this day's ride, but comfortable in mind.

"`21st.--Feel oppressed with a cold this morning,
but as my thoughts have been frequently turned toward the inhabitants of this place,
we sent for a Friend last night, and consulted about a suitable place for a meeting.
A pretty large, convenient house, which had been occupied by the Presbyterians,
but not used lately, was thought of, and as some of the members have offered it freely,
it has been accepted, and a meeting appointed at six o'clock this evening.
Much fatigued most of this day, I expect from yesterday's exertion and having caught cold.
I felt so dull and heavy, that though I endeavoured to read,
seemed as if I could not understand.
Went to the meeting, which was much crowded, and forgot my infirmities,
and it proved an open, relieving opportunity.
In the close appointed another at the same hour tomorrow evening;
returned home and felt pretty well and comfortable, and lay down so.
Thanks be rendered to the Lord my helper.

"`22nd.--To the week-day meeting, where some few neighbours came in,
and I had an instructive time of enlargement.
The meeting at six o'clock was long in gathering, but crowded at last,
and a very full opportunity to me; ending solidly and well.

"`23rd.--My mind has been turned at times since coming into this place,
towards the fishermen, and this morning after breakfast,
Friends took upon them to go around to their houses and
request the attendance of their wives and children,
and as many of the husbands also as were on shore.
The time fixed was five o'clock, as that seemed to suit best for this class of people.
Many came, and some late, so that the meeting was long, perhaps nearly two hours,
in gathering: it was trying to me to labour under such unsettlement; however,
feeling love to them, I began and endeavoured to lead their minds into staidness;
and though for a season it was hard work,
and it seemed as if I had to encounter a dead mass, hard to get over,
yet after this time of conflict, my heart was much enlarged, and tongue loosened;
and I trust through divine favour extended, it was a good time to many,
holding near four hours; and my mind was much relieved--the Lord have the praise.

"`24th.--Not apprehending myself clear of this place, and several Friends being with me,
I mentioned it to them,
and proposed holding a meeting in the house we have occupied of late;
with which they united,
and the people were encouraged to come at eleven o'clock tomorrow,
especially the fishermen.
This has been a pretty quiet day.
Took a walk for health along the shore, and the fishermen seemed to know me,
and were respectful.

"`25th, first-day.--Half year's meeting in Philadelphia; and the enquiry is,
how fare my dear wife, children, and aged mother,
and other relations and friends left behind?
It is now nearly three months since my last letter from home was dated.
I have endeavoured to resign up all into the hands of an overruling,
wise and merciful Lord and Master, who was pleased to separate me from them.
Several of my friends,
neighbours and acquaintances have been removed away from this stage of action since,
and very likely more will be before I reach home,
even if it is the Lord's will I should do so.
What better then than to labour after resignation, and be favoured to say,
'Your heavenly will be done, by and towards us all.'

"`To meeting at the Presbyterian meetinghouse.
It soon gathered, and was an open, enlarged time in testimony amongst them.
I invited them to come again at the sixth hour.
Dined at E. M.'s, and afterwards had a religious opportunity with the family,
in which a youth who is apprenticed to him, lately from Ackworth school, was much broken.
At six o'clock went to the meeting, which was uncommonly crowded;
it seemed to me that if the house had been as
large again it would probably have been filled:
it held until past eight o'clock.
Another much enlarged time, though pretty close work to begin, and it ended comfortably.
At the close of it I took my farewell of the inhabitants,
and told them there was but one thing more that rested on my mind, and that was,
to see the children of various descriptions together tomorrow evening at six o'clock;
for I had observed how many of them crowded at times into those we held,
and some others at the gate, who were not permitted to come in.

"`26th.--This morning feel refreshed and well, favoured with a ray of light,
life and comfort on my bed.
Thanks be to God, who gives us victory and peace, through our Lord Jesus Christ, his Son.
After breakfast W. W., a gaily dressed person called in, and we had agreeable,
open conversation.
He appears to be an enlightened man, and is desirous of more meetings being held:
he invited us to dine with him tomorrow.
After he went away, there came in a poor Welsh woman,
who appeared much tendered--not talkative, but quiet;
and as we sat in stillness together, my thoughts were turned towards a people afar off,
and I was comforted in the prospect of the possibility of having those raised up,
even amongst the poor, who would own me, and care for me.

When she departed she desired the Lord might go with and bless me.
I took a walk for nearly two hours along the sea shore,
and on my return a woman with ribbons about her head, came to see me,
and said she wanted to take me by the hand,
and signified her thankfulness for the opportunities she had had at the meetings,
but rendered the praise unto God,
and requested she might be permitted to be at the children's meeting.
We went at six o'clock, and I felt very poorly.
There was a very great collection indeed.
When we went in, there was much buzz and noise among those in the galleries, etc.,
and John Bevans endeavoured to quiet them by speaking to them,
but it appeared to me to be of but little use, the meeting not being full,
and many came in afterwards.
I thought it best to try to get under exercise, and feel for the inward balance.

The house was crowded with people of many sorts, of the upper, middle, and lower ranks.
After some time I felt strength to stand up, though in much bodily weakness,
hardly able to speak, in consequence of being so hoarse;
but I told them in the beginning, that though many of them were noisy and rude,
I felt love to them through all.
There was a pretty great calm and quiet soon after I began to speak,
for I stood some time first; and it continued,
and though I laboured in great bodily weakness, and felt much spent afterwards,
it afforded me much relief, and considering all things was a pretty good meeting.

Several spoke to me on coming out: one goodly woman,
who appeared to have the care of some children of the upper rank,
desired a blessing might go with me.
I felt, when I got home, as though a fit of illness was coming on,
and that I must go to bed, but in a little time, by taking something warm,
it seemed like a cordial, and brought me to.
O what sweet peace flowed into my mind on the breaking up of this last finishing meeting!
I thought that if sickness, or anything else in the ordering of Providence,
came upon Brighton, I was clear of their blood.

"`27th.--Felt peaceful and comfortable on awaking this morning.
After breakfast went with my companion to see a public housekeeper,
who was sick of a fever, and had a good time in his chamber--it was at his request.
Afterwards went to Dr. H.'s, whose wife I heard was in a desponding, low way;
here we had a comfortable time; both husband and wife were loving,
and he wished more meetings to be held, as have others also.
After an opportunity with a number of Friends who stepped in, I took leave;
we mounted our horses, and accompanied by John Glaisyer, got to W. G.'s, sixteen miles.
On the way several fishermen, etc., saluted me, and a man on horseback, as we passed him,
said to us, 'Are you going on?
On telling him we were, he desired with tears that the Lord would bless me.
This morning's ride has been a sweet one, for I feel recruited in bodily health,
and sweet peace covers my mind on leaving Brighton.
Remember it, O my soul, in low, stripping seasons: sanctify the Lord your God,
let him be your fear and dread, who has been your helper through deep baptisms of late,
and unto whom belongs honour and glory, thanksgiving and praise,
who only and alone is worthy, and nothing due to man.

"`During this scene at Brighton, my mind has been turned toward our dear companions,
from whom we parted for the work's sake:
may the same Almighty hand which has graciously helped me, protect and preserve them.
Not far from the place where W. G. lives, is the seat of Roger Clough,
where William Penn used to live, called Worminghurst.

"`28th.--Set off about seven o'clock.
On taking leave of a daughter about ten years old,
I told her my desire was that she might be dutiful to her parents,
loving to her brother and sisters,
and particularly to set a good example to her younger sisters;
and that when the evil one tempted her to do what was not right,
she should resist him and not yield, and then he would leave her,
and she would feel sweet and comfortable.
She broke forth into tears, and said,
'O he does tempt and try me:' and I learned by her parents,
that she complains of the temptations with which she is beset.
I have not often met with such a child.
We proceeded on to Alton, where we found our friends Susanna Horne and Sarah Fairbank:
a number of Friends spent the evening with us,
and I thought I was quite as cheerful during this day's ride,
and also since coming into this place last evening, as was profitable for me.
Surely I have need to be watchful, not only in the winter season,
but also on the summer's day, lest my garments get defiled.
I trust my mind is humbled this morning.

"`29th.--To the select meeting at eight o'clock, and afterwards to the quarterly meeting.
The public labour fell on Susanna Horne.
I felt nothing to communicate until the queries were answered in the men's meeting;
and I thought myself a poor thing to say anything amongst Friends,
for I felt like one going down again into sorrow and exercise.
We dined at E. and H. Marshall's, and afterwards went to Deborah Merryweather's,
where a number came, and my soul was much clothed with sorrow and exercise,
and I ventured to bend in supplication, and afterwards to speak to a very tried state.
I thought there was need for me to cry out for myself.

"`30th.--Went to several families with Susanna Horne and Sarah Fairbank,
but no communication was laid on me.
I accompanied our women Friends to Samuel May's,
where we had a memorable time after dinner; and I may with gratitude acknowledge,
that after I had ventured to bend in supplication, I say ventured,
because it is an awful thing, and afterwards in communication,
my mind obtained considerable relief, and felt more easy.
Marvellous are the dispensations of Providence.
No way opens further into this county, or further westward.
I feel glad and well satisfied that I am here,
having fulfilled pretty much what opened on my mind when in the north,
respecting the meetings through the counties where my lot of late has been cast,
even with respect to the public ones.
The Lord is a merciful and tender master,
and has accepted my feeble endeavours to serve him.
Stand resigned then, O my soul, to whatever further dispensations may be meted out.
Drank tea at W. C.'s, and had a tendering opportunity,
and believe some of them were strengthened by it.
Returned home;
and though I have had some religious communication in the opportunities this day,
yet felt very poor and solitary in the evening.

"`31st.--Our women Friends having seen their way to move, are gone; mine seems hedged up.
I struggled along until after dinner,
and I hope did not much appear to the company to fast.
Soon after John Bevans, my patient, kind companion and I,
accompanied by Samuel May as guide, took horse for Godalming.
It was pleasant once more to be on horseback, and for a little time I felt more lightsome.
In this eighteen or nineteen miles ride we had to go over a pretty large heath,
or tract of poor land.
I lagged behind my company under much exercise of mind,
and thought I could have laid prostrate on the earth, with my mouth in the dust,
if so be there might be hope.
Put up at the widow Mary Waring's, where I met with a very affectionate reception.

"`Fourth month 1st, first-day.--I feel disposed to say, through best help extended,
I will wait and I will hope; often coming to the conclusion,
that it is not good for me to be long without such strippings;
and in the midst of them believe I do not feel a murmuring thought;
and indeed why should I, when I have experienced so often,
that the will of the Lord is my sanctification.
Went to meeting and sat it through in silence, and felt content.

"`To afternoon meeting,
and was led in a particular manner to address the youth under visitation,
and to deal pretty closely with some other states.
The meeting of ministers and elders began at six o'clock, and held late, which was,
I thought, a satisfactory time.

"`2nd.--To quarterly meeting, where I sat nearly two hours,
with nothing stirring as to the ministry.
Elizabeth Waring appeared in a few words, also Hannah Pryor, and Ann Christy.
Soon after I felt an opening to stand up, and had a pretty tendering time.
The business did not end until about four o'clock; but it was a satisfactory meeting,
in which some ground was gained.
A committee was appointed to help the monthly meetings to labour with respect to tithes.
Dined at home,
and had a tendering opportunity with a pretty large company of youth and others,.

"`3rd.--I sat the monthly meeting in much quiet, under exercise.
Dear Hannah Pryor, who still continues in the neighbourhood,
I thought had a lively communication.
In the business part of the meeting I felt desirous that
individuals should prepare their spiritual accounts,
which I expressed, and I was humbled into tears,
in resignation to the Lord's blessed will.
My way closes in this neighbourhood, and seems opening towards London again,
O Lord my God, to you I look, to you I cry:
hitherto you have helped and sustained my wading soul,
and for this favour I bless your name,--even for so
much quietude of mind as I feel at this present moment.
To-day I heard of fresh fears and cares possessing the
public mind respecting the state of affairs.
I have heard very little of late respecting things in this land,
or the commotions and stirrings further off;
yet it seems as if my mind was in sympathy with the nation at large.
But these things I leave to the great and merciful Judge of all the earth,
and proceed to my feelings respecting myself and getting on.
After dinner had a memorable opportunity with the
family where we have been kindly entertained,
and a number of others.
Left them very tender, and many of them in tears; mounted our horses and rode to Esher,
fourteen miles, and felt easy and comfortable.

"`4th.--Lodged in a room richly furnished; yellow silk damask curtains to my bed,
and silk curtains to the windows, etc., and on looking over the house this morning,
I do not find much difference between it and the duke of Norfolk's,
over which John Bevans, John Glaisyer, and I, went with the duke's servant,
by his orders, when at the castle at Arundel.

"`I have lodged in very humble habitations in time past,
and was favoured with sweet peace and content.
Lord, preserve in what may yet be meted out, that your will may prove my sanctification.
'Verily I say unto you, there is no man that has left house or brethren, or sisters,
or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's,
but he shall received a hundred fold now in this time, houses and brethren, and sisters,
and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come,
life eternal.'
I have enjoyed fruitful fields and beautiful gardens for a moment, perhaps as sweetly so,
from the great Giver of all good things, as some of the owners of them.
Thanks be given where they are due, says my soul.

"`We attended the week-day meeting, which was a small one.
I sat nearly or quite two hours;
but towards the last felt an opening to minister to the states of others.
It was a quiet and pretty comfortable time.
In the afternoon rode to London.
My companion took me home with him to Charter-house square,
where we found Sarah Fairbank and Susanna Horne; they had not been long from Staines.
I staid and drank tea,
and after a little sweet opportunity in the family of my friend and kind companion,
he sent me in a coach to Broad street, where I met an open,
kind reception from my beloved friends Joseph and Rachel Smith,
and lay me down quiet in mind,
having no cause to doubt my returning to London once more being right,
though I can see nothing fully at present.

"`5th.--Arose with a calm and resigned mind.
O then, that like a child, I may be favoured to behave myself resignedly,
given up to wait to know the Lord's will,
who has of late led me about and deeply instructed me.
Magnify his name, O my soul, and forget not his benefits.

"`6th.--Attended the meeting for sufferings,
and had to remind them of the day of sifting and trial coming, I endeavoured, I hope,
faithfully to clear my soul.
Went home with Truman Harford and lodged.

"`7th.--Tears were my food on rising this morning, and viewing my condition.
O Lord! help still with a little of your soul-sustaining help.
After dinner joined a committee of the monthly meeting in visiting a Methodist minister,
who is convinced of Friends' principles,
and sat with them to a good degree of satisfaction.
I got safe home to Joseph Smith's,
and spent the remainder of the evening pleasantly with them.

"`8th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting,
and was largely engaged once more in pleading with the gay, first-day morning professors,
with encouragement both to them and those of a different description also,
to a good degree of satisfaction and relief.
In the afternoon attended the same meeting, where Mary Lloyd of Birmingham, sat by me,
and we were both led in the same line of communication, to a mourning, desolate state.

"`9th.--To morning meeting, exercised in mind--a little book on Tithes was read, etc.
In the afternoon to Tottenham with Susanna Horne,
and once more met an affectionate reception from the father and daughter Martha.`"

In a letter to his wife, dated fourth month 9th, 1798, at London, he says:

"`I came to London last week,
after an excursion of about two months into the counties of Kent, Sussex,
and part of Surrey and Hampshire,
and have had sweet peace in an honest discharge of duty, both amongst Friends and others;
having had six public meetings in the town of Brighton, on the sea coast,
before I could leave that place.
Whether I shall stay in or about London until after the yearly meeting,
I cannot fully see.
I believed it my place to enter into this great city again,
where clouds of exercise seem gathering around me;
and if it is my lot in the will of God to be here,
and suffer with my brethren and sisters, if suffering should be their lot,
I have no reason to question and say to my Master, 'Why do you deal thus with me?'
O may I still be favoured to sanctify the Lord my God,
and let him be my fear through the remainder of my pilgrimage in this land,
is my soul's desire.
The outgoings of my heart have been towards my dear companion in life,
with desires that Almighty God may sweeten every bitter cup to her.`"

"`10th.--I came back to London and its neighbourhood in resignation to the Lord's will,
ready and willing to refit and move on, if it is his will,
to the further part of the land;
having little desire to stay here and hereaway until after yearly meeting,
although thereby I may see many dear Friends, also some of my country folks.
A prospect has at different times opened, of some further service out of London.
But now all seems closed up as in times past, and I am again a poor blank.
Were it not for soul-sustaining help in some of those trying winter seasons,
I should fear getting into a state of despair; but hitherto the Lord has helped,
and I will endeavour still to trust Him,
though he may permit me to go down yet deeper into the valley and shadow of death.
May I wait for a day of deliverance, and be content with my bonds.

"`11th.--To the burial of James Townsend: the corpse was taken to Peel meeting.
My trouble multiplied on me.
I went to the ground, and though I felt a poor creature,
yet I ventured to stand forth amongst the people in a short testimony;
after which I returned with my very kind friend J. H. and children.

"`12th.--To meeting, which was altogether silent: my soul could do little more than cry.
Lord have mercy, and wash and cleanse me.

"`13th.--Spent this day pretty much in adjusting and endorsing my letters and papers.
Received a letter last evening from S. H.;
it appears by it that he was not satisfied with what I delivered in meeting.
Thus I get along--often a poor staggering one; through good and evil report,
and often weeping over my own infirmities.
My soul has this day craved mercy, with sighs and cries, in the language of the Psalmist;
'Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; preserve my life from the fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the secret council of the wicked;
from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity.'

"`16th, second-day.--Went to London, and had a memorable ride;
the flesh warring against the spirit, to bring me into bondage.
After calling to see several Friends, I took a pensive, thoughtful walk over the fields,
and my sorrow was stirred within me,
and know not how to record my distress better than in David's words;
'Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not yourself from my supplication.
Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked:
for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me, or covered me.
And I said.
Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness,
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest,'

"`18th.--Awoke pretty early, and lay in a pensive, thoughtful frame of mind,
looking over my movements, and felt an earnest solicitude and prayer arise,
that I might be favoured to settle down into greater resignation of soul,
and to bear with greater patience my yoke and bonds.
I have been struggling with a prospect that has at times opened,
to go again into the north of England on the opposite side of the island,
to that it was my lot to be in last summer,--to Scotland,
and even further if it is the will of God.
I came to London fully resigned, I trust, to this prospect,
and to refit and go off before yearly meeting;
but it appears the time is not yet fully come, if it does come at all,
and now the cloud rests upon my prospects.
No opening to religious service presents, and at seasons the lion roars against me.
O that I could be quiet and behave myself more like a weaned child,
with submissive dependence upon an all-wise Father:
this condition has looked very desirable this morning.
O then, my soul, seek for divine assistance to press more and more into it,
leaving those things that are behind, and the trying,
perplexing thoughts that so often set themselves in array against you.
There is yet mercy, forgiveness and truth with the Lord, that he may be feared;
and with him is plenteous redemption.
Hope in him, that you may praise him in a day to come,
and know him to be the health and light of your countenance, and your God,
who has helped you over many difficulties in days and years past.
I desire to lay prostrate before him, humbled in dust and ashes.
There is no hiding from the all-seeing eye of Heaven.
The language of my soul is, 'Why have you forsaken me;
or wilt you forsake or overlook your poor servant;' and yet,
is it not a great thing to be favoured to think, and to say, 'though you slay me,
yet will I trust in you.'

"`19th.--In a lonely, pensive walk,
I was favoured to think how easy a thing it would be with the mighty
One of Israel to change the dispensation respecting my soul.
I thought,
how joyful it would be to live to see truth and
righteousness flourish in London and its neighbourhood,
and living zeal for the law and testimony increase,
and that I might joy and rejoice with them that rejoice.
Went to meeting and sat it through in thoughtful silence,
endeavouring to sum up my accounts since leaving Brighton, and settle them,
and hope my soul was truly humbled.

"`21st. seventh-day.--My soul is under oppression.
What a staggering condition I seem to be in,--like a drunken man, but not with wine,
but with the cup handed me by my gracious Lord to drink of.
The cup which my heavenly Master gives, or sees cause to permit to be dispensed,
shall I not drink it?
yes; my soul craves ability to dwell here, all the Lord's time... I thought this day,
how willingly could I enter into any religious
service the Lord might be pleased to call for,
even the honourable service of the best of pay masters, either amongst my friends,
or amongst the people at large.
On the way home my mind became more calm, and Waltham Abbey meeting came into view,
and a willingness to go and sit quietly amongst the
little company that is to assemble there tomorrow.
My soul was bowed in thankfulness,
and spent the remainder of the evening quiet and serene.

"`22nd. first-day.--Arose with calmness and resignation.
A very fine morning as to the outward,--and may I say,
When shall I be favoured to behold the opening of another spring-time
in my soul! when will the singing of birds be heard,
with the voice of the turtle dove.
Is it not more fit and acceptable to say, 'Not my time and will, but yours, O Lord,
who does all things well:
fit and prepare my soul to bear with becoming patience
all the dispensations of your providence,
whether spiritual or temporal.
Wash away my secret faults; cleanse me from them and your will be done.

Went to Waltham, accompanied by W. F., his son William,
and J. W. I was silent in the meeting, yet favoured with some sight and prospect,
not the sign of the prophet Jonas, but that of Ezekiel.
O how little opening appears in places.
I have faith to believe it will not be so always;
but when the rod has been exercised for a time,
there will be an open door for the servants and messengers.
My soul craves a share of labour in this blessed day, yet with humble submission.
The opening I was favoured with was sweet,
and I thought if it was the Lord's will to remove me from my troubles here.
He who made me, and has thus far supported, borne up, and corrected me also,
would have mercy on me.
May thankfulness fill my soul for this sense.
J+++.+++ H. and daughter dined with us, and after dinner we dropped into silence,
in which he had some religious communication, much of which I thought fitted my state.
The afternoon meeting was dull and laborious,
but near the close J. H. spoke fitly to my tried state; it was reviving and encouraging,
and I felt willing to receive a crumb handed forth through a fellow servant,
and one who in man's estimation is weak.

"`24th.--O,
if the fat and full in this land are brought to feel the
situation my soul has laboured under for three years,
it will be a time of mourning indeed.
May such a sense, if permitted,
prove a time of enlightening and gathering to the true Shepherd and Bishop of souls.
The Lord hasten the blessed day of flocking unto Zion, as doves to the window of the ark.

"`25th.--Something like the lifting up of the head was my thankful experience today,
in a long and thoughtful walk.
I remembered this passage of Scripture, and when I returned read it to my comfort;
'God has spoken once, twice have I heard this, that power belongs to God.'
The Lord's servant breaks forth, both before and after these expressions, in this way,
and it appears applicable to my state; 'Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I cry unto you, when my heart is overwhelmed:
lead me to the rock that is higher than I. God has spoken once, twice have I heard this,
that power belongs unto God: also unto you, O Lord, belongs mercy,
for you render to every man according to his work.'
These expressions also impressed my mind in my walk;
'I stand continually upon the watch tower in the day time,
and am in my ward whole nights.'

"`27th.--In the evening I felt my mind turned in near love and desire for the
preservation of B. B. I rejoiced in feeling once more the arising of love,
I trust gospel love, and to find a small return of the precious gift to me.
My heart was also broken in a sense of the great love and tenderness which
both of the parents and the children of this family had manifested to me.

"`Fifth month 6th,
first-day.--Thinking a little last evening of going to Grace-church street meeting,
and mentioning it to my kind friends, was encouraged; but on arising this morning,
such was the sense of my weakness and unworthiness,
that for a time I could not persuade myself it was
right to attend to the little motion felt last evening;
yet as the way seemed most open,
I set off accompanied by S. D. In the meeting I bent in supplication,
which much relieved my mind,
and again after a lively communication through
dear A. C. I ventured to utter a few sentences,
expressive of the love I felt to that assembly, and which,
thanks be to Him who is ever worthy, flowed through me to the king on the throne,
and also to the lowest of his subjects.
'By this we know we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.'
To the afternoon meeting at Tottenham.
I had a pretty open time,
especially in love and sympathy towards some of the youth present.

"`10th.--Four years this day since I left my own habitation.
Went to Tottenham monthly meeting.

"`11th.--Not without a portion of sorrow and sadness on awaking this morning.
Bowed in prayer before leaving my chamber, begging for preservation.
I looked back to my conflicts this day four years: ah! it was a day to be remembered,
if I may indulge for a moment.
But is it not better to endeavour to forget the things that are behind, and press forward.
O that I may be accounted worthy to be yet numbered amongst the Lord's servants.
I have remembered the kind and consolatory expressions of our Lord to his disciples;
'You are they which have continued with me in my temptations,
and I appoint unto you a kingdom; even as my Father has appointed unto me.'`"

The following is extracted from a letter addressed to him by his friend Ann Crowley,
dated:

Aylesbury, 10th of Fifth month, 1798.

Dearly beloved friend,

Your affectionate and sympathetic communication merited an earlier reply;
but I have no doubt you wilt believe, and that because experience has taught you,
that minds occupied in a service so weighty and important as is our present calling,
meet with various occurrences to prevent writing,
even to those we dearly love and are nearly united to,
by the binding tie of gospel fellowship.
Thus from frequent exercises, and sensible feeling of great weakness of mind and body,
I have been prevented from acknowledging,
that your token of continued remembrance and regard was
truly salutary to my tried and stripped mind;
and perhaps it could not have reached my hands at a season when more needed,
for it arrived just as I was sitting solitary and mournful,
not knowing which way to move, or what offering to make to obtain peace;
distress clothed my mind and darkness seemed on every hand.
The spring of gospel ministry had been long shut up, and appeared as a fountain sealed;
my mind was like a stranger and alien to the knowledge of divine things;
I thought as much so as though none of the mysteries of
the kingdom had ever been unfolded to me.
In this tried, proved state of mind, I found few could fathom my exercises,
though several pitied,
and were ready to hand forth a little advice,--such as wishing me to be faithful,
and not carry such a burden from meeting to meeting, and thereby weaken my hands,
and similar communications; all which were administered in great tenderness and love,
and I could receive them as such; I thought they only tended to add to my tribulations,
for all was as much sealed from me,
as though I had never received any qualification or commission to preach the gospel.
I was ready to call all former experiences in question,
and to conclude I never had known a being anointed and appointed for that service.
This was my situation when your kind letter came to hand,
which felt like balm to my soul; no doubt but you wilt admit,
if you remember what you wrote, that it was a suitable cup of consolation;
it felt to me like a little brook by the way, for which unmerited favour,
gratitude was raised in my heart to the Lord,
and I was thankful to feel he had not forgotten to be gracious,
but had once more extended his never failing hand of help in the needful time.
I did believe it was of his goodness to put it in your mind thus to address a poor,
weary traveller,
to whose frequent baptisms and exercises I believe my
beloved friend is not altogether a stranger;
for having trodden a trying path yourself,
you can more intimately dip into a sympathetic feeling with such,
who in some degree may have to walk in similar footsteps.
Yes, I verily believe the union and communion of spirits is such,
that we are permitted sensibly to feel one another's exercises and trials,
before any outward information reaches our ears.
Great is the privilege; indeed I felt it so; for I can say in perfect freedom,
that in the course of all my travels I have not met with one
that could so feelingly fathom my state of mind,
as you were enabled to do, my endeared friend,
though we were so widely separated as to the body; may I ever walk worthy of such notice,
is the craving of my heart.

I wish not to dwell too much on a relation of the many probations and deep exercises,
which in unerring wisdom have fallen to my lot in the course of this journey,
but rather call to mind and commemorate the gracious
dealings of the Lord with us and with his people.
How wonderfully has he at times opened both the door of utterance and entrance,
so that we have been constrained to acknowledge, 'Great and marvellous are your works.
Lord God Almighty; just and true are all your ways, O King of saints.'
Is he not working wonders in the earth'.' yes, verily, our eyes are made to behold,
as well as our faith renewed to believe;
so that at seasons we can bless and adore his holy name, and say,
'You are a long-suffering, gracious God; inviting all, even the transgressors in Israel,
to return and come to your banqueting house, where your banner over them will be love.'
It is probable my beloved friend may have heard,
that our line of labour has not been altogether confined to our religious Society;
but for the enjoyment of that peace,
which obedience to the renewed manifestations of duty can alone purchase,
we have been made willing to have public meetings in many places; this you wilt,
I have no doubt, conclude has not been a little proving to my faith;
particularly as my much beloved companion has little draft this way,
though she has nearly and feelingly sympathized
and felt with me in this arduous engagement;
the secret travail of her spirit has been precious and strengthening to my mind.
When the burden of this concern came weightily on my shoulders, how did nature shrink,
so that I was ready to say, if it be possible let the cup pass from me;
for I am no way qualified,
and the undertaking is too mighty for one so little instructed in the
school of Christ;--there is great danger of my supporting,
or attempting to support the ark unbidden, and thereby bringing a reproach on the truth,
and condemnation to my own soul.
Such like reasonings took place;
but after consultations of this sort I plainly saw my peace of mind and health of body,
depended on obedience.
Then was I reduced into such a state of resignation, as enabled me to say,
as one formerly; 'If you wilt give me bread to eat,
(spiritual bread,) and raiment to put on,
(the robes of righteousness and peace,) then shall the Lord be my God,
and I will obey him.'
When brought into this state of mind, I experienced way to be made,
where I saw no way before; the mountains skipped like rams,
and the little hills like lambs.

I am ashamed of myself,
when I see the full dedication of heart dear Sarah Lynes manifests to the world,
by her resignation and obedience to such singular requirings; may she be preserved,
so as in the winding up of time, to experience the answer of, 'Well done,' etc.,
is often the desire of my mind, as well as for myself, and all other exercised servants.
We have several times fallen in company with dear Charity Cook and Mary Swett;
I think them valuable, choice Friends:
I wish their honest labours of love may be blessed to
the inhabitants of this highly favoured nation.
Charity Cook's gift lies much amongst other societies;
Mary's much confined to our own band; however, they seem nearly united.
We parted from them at Warwick--they have gone the Oxford road to London.`"

"`15th.--What a scene I have passed through in the five months past!
What deep plunges at seasons--what stops and stays; what blindness, weakness and poverty;
and yet, not without intervals of light, life, strength and boldness.
My soul desires to know what true humility is,
and begs to be favoured to lay prostrate on the approach of the annual assembly,
that in and through that, I may be found in my allotment.
O Lord be merciful! wash and cleanse me;
grant more victory over weakness and frail nature--gird
me about with a portion of your strength.

"`18th.--The opening of the yearly meeting, and I am in a very broken, poor condition.
The all-seeing eye knows how it is with me, and this has been some consolation:
I feel no disposition to hide.
What can such a weak creature do better,
than labour after ability to breathe forth this language in secret,
to him that sees in secret; 'Though you slay me, yet will I trust in you.'
Attended a large meeting in one of the new houses.
My mind was bowed, and my heart in some degree broken;
and after a lively communication through my dear country-woman, Charity Cook,
I ventured to prostrate myself in supplication.
Martha Routh had a searching time, which was a relief to my mind,
Elizabeth Ussher uttered a few words in prayer near the close.

"`19th.--Having had my thoughts turned for several days toward Westminster,
I went there this morning with Thomas Colley.
The labour fell on him, and I was content.
At the close I gave liberty to invite the people to come in the evening.
Went to meeting at five o'clock, and had a pretty good time.
E+++.+++ H. from Ireland, was also engaged, and Martha Routh appeared in solemn prayer.

"`21st.--To select meeting,
where dear John Wigham and Martha Routh gave in their certificates,
and a sweet account of their visit to our country.
It was a good meeting.
The opening of the meeting for business at four o'clock was a profitable, good sitting.

"`22nd.--Two sittings of the yearly meeting.
The time was spent in reading the answers to the queries, as far as Surrey,
and some good remarks were made: very little fell on me, and I had a quiet, peaceful day.

"`23rd.--To a meeting for worship at Devonshire house,
where I had a pretty open time of encouragement to the burden-bearers and tried ones.
Deborah Darby, and also my country-women.
Charity Cook and Mary Swett, had a share in the labour.
After which I went to William S. Fry's, where I found a large company,
and was exercised in religious communication.
In the afternoon meeting for business,
my mmd was engaged to speak in testimony against appointing such members as
are not faithful to support the precious testimonies of Truth at home;
and sending them to yearly meeting to open their mouths,
to the afflicting and wounding of their brethren.

"`24th.--Attended meeting, and also sat with the committee to prepare epistles,
in which an opportunity was given to relieve my mind of an exercise,
respecting those who were fit members for employment in the services of society,
and those who were not.

"`26th.--O humbling prospect! were it not that my soul has been given to believe,
that the everlasting Arm still remains to be underneath, should I not faint indeed!
Have faith in God then, O my tried soul.
I sat with the large committee, which got on comfortably with the business,
and at eleven o'clock went to the yearly meeting.
After meeting,
I mentioned to Truman Harford a prospect I had
of seeing the neighbours together at Ratcliff,
and which weightily opened upon my mind in yearly meeting.

"`27th, first-day.--My exercise seems of late to begin with morning light.
O may I be favoured to turn my attention, with singleness of heart,
to the meeting appointed at Ratcliff,
that so through the Lord's help his holy name and truth may be honoured.
O Lord be pleased to help me.
Went to Ratcliff, accompanied by my friend Susanna Horne, where was a large meeting,
mostly made up of people of other societies.
It proved an open time,
from the passage of Scripture describing Peter's seeing the sheet let down,
and being fitted to go with the messengers.
The same good hand which worked in Peter's heart, and prepared him for the service,
opened also the heart of Cornelius to receive the message.
A young man came to me after meeting,
and said his doubts were now removed respecting our Society.
Attended an evening meeting in the same place, which was large,
and another favoured time, in which my mind was comfortably relieved.

"`28th.--Very much abased and prostrate this morning,
as on the bended knees of soul and body; and a little light and hope sprang up,
in which I was enabled to believe that the Lord would break my bonds,--and
the vision was as clear as that of my coming into this land.
O then, my most merciful and adorable Lord and Master,
let your blessed will be done respecting me, and all that appertains to me.
You have shown your servant in the deeps that your hand has been at work,
and underneath--you have shown me that your
mercy reaches forth towards my dear aged parent,
and that she is under your protection;
and that you have provided an everlasting habitation for the wife of my bosom.
Lord, my soul is overcome in the sense of it.
You have shown me, that your tender notice and regard is toward my dear children.
O keep them, and let them be yours; and you have shown me,
that you wilt yet provide for me; wilt give beauty for ashes,
the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.

"`29th.--The last sitting of the yearly meeting this afternoon,
closed under a solemn calm.
I have been a plentiful sharer in deep humility
through the several sittings of this meeting;
and have been favoured to speak to the relief of my mind,
and also rejoiced in seeing truth gain ground, and in our having a precious,
solid meeting; yet my conflicts and exercise are not removed.

"`31st.--This morning I poured out my tears of distress and sorrow.
I remembered the note made a few days ago,
(28th,) and longed for ability to cast away my labour and toil, and have faith in God.
I am now shut up as in a cloud.
I could not make mention to the yearly meeting about going home,
as my friends William Savery and Sarah Harrison did.
I felt quiet and easy in that respect,
and now am as blind as ever as to any further religious service in this land.
Lord, keep me from falling on this sea of glass mingled with fire.

"`Sixth month 1st.--O Lord God, remember me in my distress,
for my soul is almost overwhelmed; forgive all my iniquities,
sanctify and prepare me for further work, in your way and in your time,
if more you have allotted for me to do.

"`3rd, first-day.--I ventured on my knees in meeting,
to beg for preservation for myself and all the Lord's conflicting servants,
wherever their lot is cast.
David's state presented, when he said, 'be merciful unto me, O Lord; be merciful unto me,
for my soul trusts in you; yes, in the shadow of your wing will I make my refuge,
until these calamities be overpast.'`"

In a letter to his son, dated London, sixth month 5th, he thus writes:

"`I am yet in London, and indeed, discouragement would thicken upon me on this account,
finding it trying to you at home,
if I had occasion to conclude that it is not in the will of God:
there would then be cause indeed to mourn; but I trust it is not in my own will,
for I meet with many fiery trials, and ups and downs,
which tend to the breaking of that in pieces.
O may my soul be preserved to the end, is my fervent prayer.
Yearly meeting is over, and an evidence has been granted me that I have been in my place:
it was very large, and sweetly owned by the Master of assemblies.
I rejoice in seeing and believing that truth and righteousness
are spreading--there being many precious young plants.
I have met with Charity Cook, Mary Swett, Sarah Talbot, Phebe Speakman, William Savery,
and also Sarah Harrison, to my comfort.
In my former letters, if they have come to hand,
you will perceive that I had got on the south side of London:
I went through two counties fully, and part of another,
and have been comforted in finding or hearing that it
has not been in vain I am a servant in waiting:--wait,
then also, all you my dear family, who are so nearly interested in my welfare,
and pray for me when you can, that I may fulfill the task,
much whereof is drinking the cup of suffering.
The cup which my heavenly Father gives me, or permits me, to drink, shall I not drink it?
O yes! and that with resignation.
May the Lord on High, who is mightier than the noise of many waters, comfort, bear up,
and sustain all your minds and also be with me.`"

"`10th.--I went to meeting in a weak state.
Both morning and evening were deeply plunging times.
After Elizabeth Ussher had appeared in a short testimony,
toward the close of the meeting in the morning, applicable to my tried state,
I ventured to go down on my knees.
The afternoon meeting appeared to me to be a very solemn time,
and I ventured to tell the assembly so.

"`14th, fifth-day.--I have remembered this morning, that it is, I think,
four years this day, since I landed at Tower wharf, London.
O the scenes my soul has passed through in and about London since that time;
and could I wish or desire that it should have been otherwise?
O no.
If the Lord is pleased to carry me through to the end, I shall have occasion to say,
'great and marvellous are your works.

Lord God Almighty; just and true are all your ways,
you King of saints! who shall not fear before you, and glorify your name.'

"`20th, fourth-day.--I have thought much of the poor and miserable people in Ireland,
who are called rebels, as well as others called protestants; the misery and sufferings,
unutterable perhaps, of many, as well as the deaths of not a few.
How has my heart throbbed within me, when I have read the account.
My mind has also been turned toward the rulers in this land; from the king on the throne,
to his ministers and servants, and I have seen that it is not fortifications,
either above or below the earth;
neither armies nor navies that will save this favoured land.
No, nothing short of the out-stretched arm of the Lord, and the people bowing before him,
and humbling themselves as in dust and ashes; keeping a fast from abominable wickedness,
and sincerely praying unto God, the only hope of salvation.

"`Seventh month, 1st, first-day.--Feel a willingness to endure all my trials,
and not to cast away my little grain of faith.
Lord, if I perish, I will perish at your feet, has been the cry of my soul.
Went to meeting at Tottenham, and near the close I ventured to bend in prayer,
having had a little opening as out of the prison window, of a day of more enlargement.
After afternoon meeting went home with William Dillwyn.
O that misspending time may not be charged against me.
Many are the charges of the accuser of the brethren, at seasons,
when my soul is in a low condition.
O Fountain of mercy, be pleased to clear my way, even if it be through the fire;
let your mercy go forth, and then my soul shall endure.
I long to be employed by you in the work of the gospel.

"`3rd, third-day.--If I dare say that my sufferings in part are for others;
and that I am dipped into sympathy with the nation at large, and in a peculiar manner,
with the city of London, (yes,
O London! my soul has been abased within you;) then most assuredly,
I believe the Lord will fulfill what he has shown to his servants the prophets.
O may my soul be favoured to partake resignedly of the cup of suffering meted out,
and not be cast off of my God.
If I am a sign to my brethren in this land, as a poor suffering servant;
Lord grant me the comfort of your holy presence, to go with me, and it will be enough.
Your power is above every power.

Draw away my affections from all hindering, earthly concerns.
Blot out and remove all my iniquities, and enable me to say.
Your will be done I desired to pray for a clear evidence,
that I was in suffering for some good purpose; and was stopped by this reflection;
where then would be the exercise of faith?
and it appeared desirable to walk by faith, if only by a grain.
O then for resignation and more contentment in the divine will.
Man by his efforts can do nothing: lie prostrate, O my soul, let the waves pass over you.
Walked over to High Cross,
and spent part of the afternoon with S. H. and W. F. At the boys' school in the evening,
and felt more free from that inexpressible weight.`"

The following is extracted from a letter received while in London,
from his beloved friend Ann Crowley:

Skipton, 6th of Seventh month, 1798.

Beloved friend,

It seems as though I could scarcely forbear embracing a
few minutes of leisure to address you,
though not from an apprehension that the expression of continued love and sympathy
can prove effectually consoling or strengthening to your deeply exercised mind
especially as it comes from one whose experience in divine things,
is that of a child's; but having felt my mind increasingly bound to you,
in the sweet fellowship of gospel love and life,
and an inclination arising time after time, to tell you as much,
I thought it might afford me some relief to say,
how near and dear you are to my best life.
I think I never felt it more so than of late, for which my soul is made thankful;
because, if my feelings have been right,
it is a union which will allow me to salute you as a brother, or should I not rather say,
a father, in tribulation, in sore conflicts and trials; when faith,
patience and hope may be reduced to a low ebb.

I think I was never more sensibly impressed with an apprehension that
a large portion of suffering has fallen to your lot,
than since we last parted in London; yes, surely it must have been so,
or I think I should not have been introduced into such a sympathetic engagement of heart,
for one whom I so dearly love, and whose firm standing and preservation,
through the various proving baptisms dispensed, I covet as my own;
knowing that nothing short of the invincible and invisible arm of God's salvation,
can support and bear up the tossed, tribulated mind, through the vicissitudes of time.
An establishment in this belief leads to a daily breathing in the pathetic language;
'Arise O God! strengthen your feeble servant with might in the inner man,
that so preservation and perseverance through all may be experienced.

But there are seasons when your poor friend cannot lift
up her soul to Heaven and cry for daily bread;
but, feels hardness of heart,
and distress of mind,--can justly compare her state to the heath in the desert,
and knows not when good comes;
can hear her fellow travellers and friends tell of the
humbling seasons of refreshment they are made to partake of,
when she is not able to utter, scarcely a rightly begotten sigh or groan,
or shed a mournful tear;
but all that proceeds from the only source of good is vailed from her,
as things she had never partaken of in former seasons.

Is this an experience with which my beloved friend is experimentally acquainted?
Surely it feels to me, as if a similar bitter portion has been given him to drink,
in the course of his pilgrimage; and if this should have been the case,
it may afford me some encouragement; because I am firm in the belief,
that your sufferings have not only abundantly qualified for service in the Lord's work,
but they have brightened you, as a well polished instrument,
fitted to execute the office intended.

Therefore, permit me to say in simplicity, though in integrity of heart; 'Be not afraid,
neither too much cast down or discouraged, for the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
is your God;' He will be your buckler, your shield,
and your battle axe,--that so no weapon formed against you,
shall ever be able to prosper; but you shall be abundantly clothed upon with strength,
wisdom and understanding, so that in the midst of trials, baptisms and provings,
the acknowledgment will be raised, the Lord is worthy to be served,
to be honoured and obeyed; for though he hides his face for a season,
yet at the break of day I see the Son of Righteousness arising;
and faith is given me to believe, healing virtue is on his wings.
Can the children of the bride chamber rejoice, when the bridegroom is not with them?
And is it not a day when the bridegroom of souls is
often withdrawing himself from his church and people,
because of the degeneracy,
the lukewarmness and indifference of mind which is prevalent
amongst the high professing Christians'? Can we wonder then,
that mourning should be the appointed garment of the Lord's exercised servants,
who are rightly dipped into the present bewildered state of the church,
and see with the eye of their mind, that the beauty is fallen from Israel,
as on the high places.
Cannot some of us say at seasons, 'For these things I weep; my eye runs down with water.'
Well, dear friend, let not this cause us to faint,
for it is a precious thing to be counted worthy to
suffer for so noble a cause as righteousness and truth;
let us put on strength,
and in the name of the Lord press through every crowd of
difficulty and discouragement which may arise in the way;
working in the power of his might,
to the pulling down of the strong holds of sin and satan, not only in ourselves,
but in our fellow creatures; and establishing the kingdom of God and his righteousness;
that so an addition to the church militant may
be made by the faithfulness of the Lord's chosen,
by and through whom he is working wonders, in order that his love,
mercy and goodness may be magnified, in gathering sons from far,
and daughters from the ends of the earth,
that so a glorious addition may be made to the church triumphant.
The praise of his own works belongs alone unto Him,
who is worthy to receive honour and glory, thanksgiving and high renown; may my soul,
with thousands more, be put in a fit capacity to ascribe it forever and forever.

I have written in great freedom,
which I hope will be received in that love I feel for you,
though I know it looks a little presuming for a child
in experience to write thus to a father in the church;
but as things arose, I simply penned them.

"`13th.--On awaking this morning my exercise awoke with me.
O may I be favoured to believe that I am not cast out
of the notice and care of my heavenly Father!
May I be corrected, proved, sifted and tried, and brought into order at last.
Cleanse me from secret faults, O Lord: you know my heart; I cannot hide anything from you.
If more abasement is necessary, may it be my portion.
After breakfast went to see my country-woman, Mary Swett,
and found she was going with Sarah Harrison to look at a ship in the Thames,
bound for Germany.
I went along with them,
and they expressed peace and satisfaction while sitting in the cabin.
Tears were my food, but I endeavoured to sympathize with them,
and in a feeble manner expressed it.
After dinner accompanied several Friends to the
examination of the scholars at Clerkenwell,
and at the close ventured to address them.`"

The following is an extract of a letter, dated seventh month 23rd, 1798,
addressed to his wife:

I am yet in London, and when I shall feel clear and easy to leave it,
and when I shall be favoured to leave this land and return to my native one,
is at present hid from me.
My mind has passed through much exercise and conflict since yearly meeting,
and I endeavour as much as in me lies, to possess my soul in patience.
How frequently have I thought of Richmond, in Virginia;
how often it was my lot to encompass that city about as a mountain, and a great one too;
and yet, at the last I left it as light, comparatively speaking, as a cork,
and never unto this day have I had a painful sensation respecting it.
A mercy, yes an unspeakable one it will be,
should my soul be thus favoured respecting this place,
into which I came early in the fourth month last.
I had been at Brighton, on the sea coast,
and passed through singular exercises in that place;
but after having five or six public meetings among them,
was favoured to leave the place with sweet enriching peace.
I saw this line of labour along the sea coast, when I was in the north last summer,
and admired how much less was accepted,
than was opened and magnified in my view at that time on looking forward.

After leaving Brighton, I went with my beloved friend John Bevans,
to Hampshire quarterly meeting,
and again met the women Friends with whom we set out from London.

After getting through the quarterly meeting,
I could not see my way into any meetings belonging to that meeting:
I looked towards Plymouth, Falmouth, etc., but all closed up; so leaving our company,
my beloved and tender companion (for so I esteemed him) and I moved on towards London,
taking the quarterly meeting of Surrey by the way, in which I thought I was in my place;
and from there came to London.
I felt sweet peace on returning, and willingly disposed to refit,
and leave it before yearly meeting, if it was the Lord's will, but could not.
I thought I was in my place during the time of holding that solemnity; but since,
I have been shut up again, and am labouring after patient resignation to the divine will.
I admire at the love and kindness of my dear friends Joseph and Rachel Smith,
who continue to be tenderly sympathizing, as also others.
Sarah Harrison, Mary Swett, Charity Cook, and George Stacey,
started a few days ago for Germany.
I saw no opening for me to go, though dear Sarah Harrison seemed to look for it,
almost to the last.
The ways of divine Providence are a great deep; too deep for a poor mortal to fathom,
and my soul craves that neither heights nor depths, nor any other creature,
may ever separate me from the mercy and love of God in Christ Jesus my Lord;
but that my soul may wade through all, and in the end be favoured to say,
'Great and marvellous are your works.
Lord, God Almighty, just and true are all your ways, you King of saints;
who shall not fear before you, and glorify your name.'`"

"`24th.--In low moments I appear to myself as an idler; but am I indeed so,
when my feelings are so unutterable from day to day?
Will not my feeble efforts in this deep suffering,
be accounted as work done in the sight of the great Master?
O that it may be so,
and that I may be favoured to cease in due time from this labour and toil.
I crave daily strength to say, Your will be done,
and for patience to endure this fight of affliction.
Attended Devonshire house meeting, and soon after I sat down,
on seeing an individual come in, this language impressed my mind,
and continued so with me, that at length I stood up with it,
and endeavoured to encourage a state which is under buffeting and trials:
'Behold the man:' dear George Dillwyn followed in the same line,
and after him William Savery.

"`25th, fourth-day.--In the fore part of the meeting today, my heart was humbled,
and I trust felt a little revival of hope,
that the Lord will carry me through all I have yet to meet
with in this land My heart is frequently melted within me,
and my cries with tears are poured out unto you, O Lord.
You have measurably favoured with a sense of your forgiveness and mercy this morning,
even in the deeps.
William Savery closed the meeting in solemn prayer, in which I united with tears,
and perhaps I never felt greater love for him at
any time in my life than in this meeting.
I spent the evening with him, and took an affectionate farewell;
and this was the language of my soul when I left him; O Fountain of mercy,
open the way for me to labour--remove the clouds; and be with my dear fellow servant,
and safely waft him over the great deep to his family and friends in peace.

"`26th.--I walked to Ratcliff meeting alone, and towards the close was engaged in prayer.
O what a dispensation this is; how I mourn along the streets of London;
and am ready to cry out unto God.
After leaving dear William Savery last evening,
I felt how easy it would be for all-powerful Help to change my condition from weakness,
to strength and firmness.
The Lord has been my helper hitherto, surely he will not leave me in this distant land,
a poor, solitary man, as a desolate captive passing to and fro.
I hope at times, that a blessing will spring out of my trials,
if my faith and confidence fail not.
When I can believe that I am doing or suffering the Lord's will, it balances my soul,
and is enough for the moment,
I went to White Chapel burial ground to the burial of Captain;
a number of his little sailor boys and others were there, f felt the evening before,
an unusual impression on being invited to attend,
and was favoured to speak at the grave,--it was a time of tears,
and some of the lads wept aloud.

"`27th.--To children's meeting at Clerkenwell; it was small, but to my great admiration,
my heart was enlarged to speak to the visited minds under trial;
and afterwards appeared in supplication.

"`Eighth month 4th, seventh-day.--A humbling morning,
and yet I hope I see that a day of deliverance and enlargement will come,
if patience is abode in.
And must I indeed wait longer and be content thus to be shut up?
Yes, I can make nothing: the maker and builder of all things is God.
O then, the prayer of my soul is, that you would bless me indeed,
that your good hand may condescend to be with me, and that you would enlarge my coast,
and keep me from evil, that it may not grieve my soul.
Cover your servant with the mantle of love, and bring up out of the deeps;
forgive his iniquities, for your name and mercy sake,
and qualify him to teach his fellow creatures your ways.
O that I could once more be favoured, through your heavenly power,
to convert and call sinners unto you.
You have done much for me,--favour me, O Lord, I pray you, to love you and your cause,
yet much more.

"`5th, first-day.--Attended the meeting at Wandsworth,
where I had to deliver a close testimony.
I thought myself unworthy, and yet feared to omit the opportunity presented.
Amongst other things told them of a people who chant to the sound of the viol,
and invented for themselves instruments of music, but forgot the afflictions of Joseph.
I was afterward informed it was true,
and that there was not strength in the meeting to labour with such.

"`7th.--Took a lonely walk, in which I remembered how I was tried,
when in the utmost bounds of Georgia, in my native land.
There I was proved for a season, and then a notable work and service opened,
and through divine assistance was performed,
and I returned with a good share of sweet enriching peace.
I also remembered, that when in New England, my soul was proved and tried,
how I lamented my state in a lonely place in the woods,
and afterwards was made use of in reconciling a meeting,
and bringing them back into love and unity.

"`In the afternoon went to the girls' school;
and soon after I sat down in the large room, where the children were at work,
they laid aside their work, and a comfortable silence ensued,
in which I felt my mind not only drawn forth in communication, but also in prayer,
and my own children were remembered,
and those of my fellow servants labouring in this land.
It was a very tendering time,
and I felt astonished that it should be so on looking at my poor, stripped state.

"`10th.--I sensibly felt my solitary condition this morning, and I said in my heart.
May I still be preserved patient this one day more: 'Cast your burden on the Lord,
he shall sustain you.'
Lord, indulge your servant with this favour.

"`11th.--Prayer with tears this morning.
And the king said unto Zadok, carry back the ark of God into the city:
if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord,
he will bring me again and show me both it and his habitation.
But if he say, I have no delight in you, behold here am I,
let him do to me as seems good unto him.'
O holy confidence in this afflicted servant,
even when he thought he was justly afflicted of his God,
thus to cast himself on the Lord: better to fall into the hands of the Lord,
than into the hands of men, for as is his majesty, so is his mercy.

When shall my feet be again shod with the preparation of the gospel,
and my commission be sealed to go forth.
I long at times that it may be so, but am checked and stopped by remembering,
that if I am happily doing and suffering according to the will of God,
I am doing what I should do; and with him, unto whom a thousand years are as one day,
my time spent in this manner may prove acceptable--so be it, says my soul.

"`19th,
first-day.--Had an open opportunity at Tottenham meeting to plead with the rich and gay,
and also bent in prayer, and supplicated for the poor prisoners,
both such as were so in spirit, and those outwardly in bonds;
and also for the poor wandering emigrants,
who are driven from their homes and all they hold dear: felt comfortable after meeting.
I long to be set further at work; and stand resigned and willing in this respect.
In the afternoon meeting I felt an opening to encourage the burden bearers and mourners.

"`Ninth month 3rd, second-day.--Have a hope I am in my place,
having felt on rising an intimation to be still, and wait in patience.
The Lord grant it may be so, with a sufficient portion of faith to believe.

"`5th.--I attended the burial of B. Head,
whose body was brought from London to Tottenham meeting-house.
To my admiration I was favoured, out of weakness to be raised into strength,
and had an encouraging tendering opportunity.

"`7th, first-day.--I am so stripped this morning on arising and dressing,
that if I can say in truth, 'Lord have mercy;'--'Lord,
save or I perish;' it is as far as I think I can go.
Went to meeting very poor;
but again through divine favour I was raised up in some degree of strength.
I could not be easy without inviting the people at
large to attend a meeting at five o'clock this evening,
which was much filled up, and proved an open, solid time.

"`13th,
fifth-day.--Scattered a few tears this morning
in my chamber on taking a view of my state;
yet not without hope.
Elisha had hope when he confidently said to his master Elijah, 'as the Lord lives,
and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.'
His master was a type of my Lord and master, Jesus Christ,
who ever lives to make intercession for us; who though ascended up on high,
still regards the low estate of his servants:--have faith then, O my soul,
in his most Holy name, who can open a way where no way appears.

"`15th.--Received a letter from Mary Dudley; amongst other sweet sisterly expressions,
the following overcame me, and brought me into contrition: 'My mind,
according to its capacity, has felt for you,
under sensations resembling deep uttering unto deep;
so that I cannot admit a doubt of its having been with
your tribulated spirit a time of sorrow and distress;
out of which if you are not yet brought, the Lord will assuredly deliver you,
and put the new song into your mouth; for he that has anointed is faithful,
and will open the two leaved gates, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.'

"`16th, first-day.--To Winchmore hill with T. H., where came many gay folks.
I went in weakness and under a sense of great unworthiness,
and sat the fore part of the meeting much so;
but could not be easy without labouring with them from the
wise man's expressions concerning weights and measures,
settling with partners, putting all down in writing, etc.,
alluding to merchants who are very punctual in settling their accounts weekly,
and thus find it easy to balance them at the years' end;
which drew me to speak of settling our accounts with the Almighty, day by day,
that so a heavy account might not remain against us in a time of sickness and death.
I told them I believed no one there had come to that meeting in a sense of greater
weakness and unworthiness than myself.--Upon returning I feel more light and easy.
How pleasant to feel thus, even for a moment.

"`19th.--My soul seems let down into sympathy with the
wretched among men--O poor tried and tempted man,
you have an advocate with the Father, who was also tempted and tried,
even Jesus Christ the righteous.

"`22nd.--A news-paper was brought to me,
containing information that the yellow fever had broken out in Philadelphia,
and that the inhabitants were very generally leaving the city.
I am thankful that my mind was favoured with such quiet this morning.

"`23rd, first-day.--This morning I looked home and said, Lord,
I desire to submit all to your disposal, who know best what is best for us;
and was willing to offer up a prayer and tear for the inhabitants of Philadelphia;
and thought also of the poor sailors wounded and mangled in the war in the Mediterranean.
Lord, your power, your mercy, spread over sea and land.
I was favoured with a pretty full and open time at Tottenham meeting.
The afternoon meeting was put off to six o'clock, and the neighbours invited;
it was a large, and I trust a solid meeting,
and I felt relieved and comfortable after it.

"`24th.--Attended the select quarterly meeting of London, which was small,
many members being abroad at watering places.
I had a pretty relieving opportunity after the queries were gone through,
and in the close was engaged in prayer.

"`25th.--Attended the quarterly meeting, and laboured in the first meeting;
that for business was an exercising time,
but at length a committee was appointed to sit with Friends of Tottenham,
and try to help them over the difficulties respecting tithes and the payers of them.

"`26th.--A more wakeful night than usual, and in those wakeful moments,
it seemed as though I had to go through yesterday's meeting again.
O how distressing is the state of these Tobiahs and Sanballats, who oppose the work,
and yet are willing to be thought in their places.

"`Tenth month 4th, fifth-day.--Went this morning to Westminster meeting, which was small,
but to me a quiet sweet time, wherein my heart was a little enlarged and lifted up,
and endeavoured to encourage others to trust in the Lord.
Mary Watson closed the meeting, I thought weightily, in solemn prayer.

"`10th.--Although no opening presents to move away from London and its neighbourhood,
yet I feel a comfortable degree of calmness and resignation.
I am going into the city to look out a little, resembling, I think,
the prophet's servant,
who was bid to go again and again to look for the arising of the cloud,
which after a time appeared the bigness of a man's hand.
Is there not a cloud gathering?
I beg for support and sustaining help a little longer.
Attended Grace-church street meeting, where dear Mary Watson was much favoured.
She seemed to have the same weapon put into her hand which I was formerly favoured with:
my spirit united while she plead with some who had known better days.`"

In a letter to his son, dated Waltham, William Dillwyn's, tenth month 13th, 1798,
he says:

"`It is now more than six months since I last came into London,
and I have been there and near it, most of the time since, and perhaps I may say,
that I never experienced a more humbling, trying dispensation; no way opening from hence,
either to any part of the kingdom which I have not visited, or to go home.
I humbly trust I am as a servant in waiting;
and if my heavenly Master is pleased to accept of suffering, buffetings, siftings,
and deep and close trials, as work done, or as filling up my measure,
then there is a hope that joy will spring up in the morning,
after the night of darkness passes away.
My mind has been turned toward you for months past,
and as I looked out of my chamber window this frosty morning, I thought,
how is it in Philadelphia?
have hundreds been numbered to the grave?
has the cold hand of death been laid on my family and relations,
or is the sickness once more removed by frosty weather?
I have earnestly laboured for months past after a qualification, morning by morning,
and often with tears of exercise and conflict, to say, 'not my will, but yours, O Lord,
be done, respecting me and all that appertains to me;' and here I have left you,
under the care and protection of Him who numbers the hairs of our head,
and without whose notice not a sparrow can fall to the ground;
and if he is pleased to permit me to see and enjoy you in a state of mutability,
any or all of you, I have said in my heart,
it will be a mercy--a favour to be acknowledged;
and if otherwise,--if the all-wise and merciful Being
is pleased to take any of you to a better place,
even a more enriching and enduring habitation.
His will be done.

I salute you with tender solicitude and love, desiring to hear from you soon,
and have yet a hope in due time, of seeing the way open with clearness to return.
Time is the Lord's, and through all I hope he has not cast me off from being his servant.
Blessed be his holy name, my soul yet craves ability to glorify him, even in the fires.`"

"`14th, first-day.--Joseph Smith accompanied me to Devonshire meeting.
I felt very low on going, and for some time after I sat down in it;
but life and strength arose,
and I had a pretty open time in ministering to a state under trials and temptations.
Near the close an opening to the people at large presented quite unexpectedly,
and I was favoured with cheerfulness and resignation to give up to it,
and appoint a meeting at six o'clock.
In the afternoon meeting was silent.
At the appointed meeting I was favoured with a comfortable relieving time.
How wonderful are the works of God in leading, instructing and feeding his messengers,
and qualifying them to speak to the people.
I was favoured to give up immediately, without consulting with flesh and blood,
to the holding of this meeting,
and had amongst other things to speak of Paul's so yielding to the heavenly vision.

"`30th.--Another humbling, heart-searching, heart-breaking morning.
The gathering of manna is a daily work; and if I can be enabled to say,
'Your will be done and not mine,' morning by morning, and evening by evening,
this is manna enough.
This has been a day of sorrow, and yet may I be truly content,
or as much so as such a poor creature dare to look for.
'I cry unto you, O Lord, and you do not hear me: I stand up, and you regard me not.'
'You lift me up to the wind; you cause me to ride upon it, and dissolve my substance.'
'When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light,
there came darkness.
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.'
How descriptive of a state of desertion, seeming desertion to us.
Even our adorable High Priest cried out in agony, 'My God, why have you forsaken me?'
and again at another time, 'I know that you hear me always.'
Why may we not believe, that by and through the intercession of so great a High Priest,
our prayers and our secret cries are heard and noticed.
Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.

"`31st.--I crave to be favoured to know an increase in this experience;
to be careful for nothing, but in every thing with prayers and supplications,
with thanksgiving, to let my needs be known unto God.
Notwithstanding all I meet with, there is abundance to be thankful for.
Lord, forgive me my frowardness and uneasiness in this sifting, proving time;
wherein my faith and confidence in your protection and care have indeed been proved.

"`Eleventh month 2nd.--I remembered these expressions of afflicted Job,
on lying down this afternoon; 'terrors are come upon me, they pursue my soul as the wind,
and my welfare passes away as a cloud,' etc.
In the evening T. H. brought me a letter from E. Cadbury, to Joseph Smith,
enclosing a paragraph of a letter from her sister, at Burlington, giving an account,
that my wife, son and daughter Mary had had the yellow fever.
My dear Mary closed her life on the 3rd of ninth month in the morning;
and it was thought my beloved Sarah and son Joseph were on the recovery.
I trembled when the letter was put into my hands to read;
having had a hint of its contents before from my friend.

After pausing a while, took it up again, and made another attempt, but failed,
and got M. Horne to read it to me.
My dear friends fell into silent sympathy with me,
and I not only thought with afflicted Job, but expressed it;
'the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'`"

The following extracts from a letter from Rebecca Jones, dated Burlington,
ninth month 26th, 1798, will give some further particulars:

My beloved friend and brother,

It came into my mind this morning, feeling you preciously brought into view,
to spend a little time in thus communing with you.
I find by accounts lately received from England by several Friends here,
that you as yet do not find a door of escape from the arduous field,
in which you have been engaged honestly to labour upwards of four years,--so that,
though we are looking for the return of dear William Savery,
(who has professed himself clear,) our expectation and
hope is suppressed concerning your returning with him.
Fervent is my solicitude on your account, dear Thomas, that your sheaves may be full,
whenever the Master may be pleased to say to your exercised spirit, 'it is enough,
go in peace.'
Dear Sarah Harrison, we hear, is unexpectedly drawn towards Germany,
and Mary Swett with her; this will be a fresh trial of faith and patience to her,
and to her beloved husband: if you write her, do hand to her and Mary Swett,
the salutation of my endeared love.

You wilt hear by other letters,
that our city has been permitted once more to
feel the dire effects of the contagious disease,
which carried off so many in 1793, and again the last year.
This then is the third stroke of the kind, and by all accounts,
more severe than the two preceding, by which many are numbered to the silent grave,
both in our city and in New York, where also it spreads rapidly.
Chester and Wilmington also are under the same humbling hand.
From all these places, the greater part of the inhabitants removed early:
but of those who remained, many have died, though many have also recovered,
and some of these left their homes soon after.

As you are more qualified to enter into our feelings than some others,
by having been amongst us in the year 1793, I need not say a great deal on that head,
and yet it will excite the tribute of gratitude
and thanksgiving to the Father of mercies,
to know that your dear wife and son,
and several other Friends who are near and dear to us,
have been safely brought through the disease: several known to you in New York,
as well as Philadelphia, etc. have fared otherwise;
concerning several of them it is sealed upon my spirit,
that they have in a state of innocency, and measurable preparation of soul,
passed quietly out of this vale of tears, into a joyous eternity of bliss and happiness.

The time for holding our yearly meeting in course, is this week;
but so few Friends are in the city, and the disease is so very heavy,
that a few of the representatives met last second-day,
and have believed it best to adjourn to the second week in next twelfth month;
and their so doing has been truly relieving to the minds of many Friends in the country,
as well as citizens that are out.
Yet, that there should be so solemn and trying a cause for it,
is deeply affecting to many of us,
who see with awfulness the renewed judgments of the Almighty displayed,
and still have reason to fear the people in general are not learning righteousness!
But the subject, my dear friend, is too heavy for me to enlarge upon at present.

I spent second-day at your father Hoskins',
and found your dear Sarah and your aged mother,
who though much weakened in her faculties, is innocent and in good health,
so that it would have been quite pleasant being with them, but for thinking of you,
and that your mind would be affected when you hear the sequel of the account,
that your precious daughter Mary is removed to a better inheritance.
She did not lay many days struggling with the disease;
her dear mother laying ill at the same time, was not acquainted with the solemn event,
until she gained a little strength, and then bore it like a Christian,
as I much desire and believe you wilt, though nature will feel on the occasion.
I believe your dear child was in a state of innocence,
and I had several times of late noticed her improvement
in solidity as she advanced in growth,
nearly to the stature of a young woman; and her tenderness for her dear mother was such,
that though they wished her to stay at Burlington, where she was a few weeks before,
she entreated them to let her go and be with her connections in the city.

My desire is, that this circumstance may not improperly affect or discourage you,
so as to prevent your proceeding with diligence to finish what
appears to remain of the work given you to do;
which when completed,
your dear connections and friends will rejoice to receive you again amongst them.

Rebecca Jones.

The reader will also be interested, it is thought,
in the following additional remarks from another hand:

Burlington, ninth month 30th, 1798.

Dear Cousin:

It is from a renewed feeling of best love, I trust,
that I am engaged to address you in this way, though in weakness.
Frequently during your absence from this land, I have in my small measure,
affectionately sympathized with you in your arduous
engagement to promote the reign of peace on earth:
And although from a fear of improperly intruding upon your attention,
I have hitherto been deterred from writing,
it is not the first time I have had it impressively on my mind.
However sensible, that to me belongs blushing and confusion of face,
in the prospect of multiplied defections from the right way of the Lord,
and this more in the way of secret faults,
and what by some might be esteemed things of no moment,
than of open violations of the law and the commandment,
yet being through the mercy and loving kindness of the Father of us all,
at seasons quickened to an ardency of desire,
that I may more and more aspire after further attainments in,
and a deeper acquaintance with the work of sanctification in the soul,
I have likewise felt a degree of solicitude,
that thousands who are yet strangers to the blessed
principle of light and grace inwardly revealed,
may not only be brought to behold its unspeakable excellency, but to close in with it,
and become subject to its blessed government.

Hence I have found my heart to flow with love inexpressible towards those who are
called conspicuously to hold up the standard of righteousness to the nations,
and publish the glad tidings of the gospel to near and to distant lands.
It has appeared to me a time of great commotion in the world,
perhaps unequalled by any which has existed at any former period;
not only wars and rumours of wars mournfully prevail,
but opinions and systems which have not the stamp of irrefutable certainty,
are made to totter on their bases; the chains which have enslaved men's minds for ages,
are measurably loosened, and unlimited freedom of inquiry, spreads far and wide.
It is however to be lamented,
that the spirit of the age has extended too far into the other extreme;
and instead of bigotry and superstition,
unrestrained licentiousness seems ready to overwhelm the people,
and to lead them still further from the knowledge of the true God.
Nevertheless,
I believe that the faithful are at seasons favoured to behold a divine hand through all,
and that it is the gracious intention of the all-seeing One,
to bring about great and marvellous acts:
and O! how important has it appeared in my view,
that the professors of Christianity every where, more especially within our pale,
withdraw themselves from every thing that defiles,
so as to exhibit to the world in its native dignity and purity,
the peaceful nature of the religion of Jesus;
thus becoming instrumental by the sufficiency of his grace,
to promote his work and advance his kingdom.

And beloved cousin, however deep the baptisms, and closely trying the exercises,
which those who are sent on the Lord's errands in this day have to undergo,
yet I have thought, that over and above the secret sustaining support which never fails,
even in times of the greatest extremity, there is great encouragement to such,
in the reflection,
that it is a day in which way is making in the hearts
of many for a more ready reception of the truth,
and wherein its messengers may be more distinguishedly
instrumental in bringing people home to its saving efficacy.
Is it not to be supposed,
that notwithstanding the vast strides which vice and profligacy have made,
the number of those among various classes is great,
who seeing the fallacy of mere forms and creeds and professions of religion,
are led to seek after something that will afford their
unsettled minds real consolation and support?

The sound of war which has so long disturbed the tranquility of Europe,
has at length also reached our borders;
whether it will be permitted to increase to any very alarming degree,
is not for us at present to know; but be this as it may,
we have awful proof that the Majesty on high,
can use other means for the punishment of a gainsaying and backsliding people.
Poor Philadelphia is a melancholy instance;
again has the pestilential cloud broken upon her;
again have her streets become almost desolate, and the voice of sadness is heard therein.
The yellow fever in its highest malignancy has
now prevailed' there for nearly two months,
and it is generally allowed, to a pitch far exceeding the memorable year 1793,
so that notwithstanding the citizens have, in a more general manner,
left it than at any former similar period,
the number of deaths considerably exceed that of '93, within the same dates.
New York is at this time, and has been for several weeks past,
in a situation not far behind it in distress,
and the desertion thereof by the inhabitants nearly as extensive.
Boston has likewise had a share of the calamity, though in a less degree;
also Portsmouth in New Hampshire, and New London in Connecticut.
At Chester and Wilmington it has raged, it is thought,
proportionately to the number of inhabitants, at least to a degree equal to Philadelphia;
and at several places, both in Pennsylvania and this state, it has made its appearance.
Thus you wilt perceive,
in what a solemn manner the sword of chastisement has again been unsheathed,
and ah! that it may be effectual to humble the haughtiness of man--to show
the children of folly and disobedience the emptiness of every mundane hope,
and induce them to repentance and amendment of life.

Among a large number of fugitives that have come here for shelter,
are about twenty Friends' families, among which is our beloved Sarah Scattergood,
with your mother, Joseph, Rebecca and the young woman.
You wilt no doubt, by other channels, be informed of many particulars respecting them,
but I apprehend it would be right for me to attempt to communicate something,
and indeed this is a principal motive of my writing at this time.
They remained in the city until within about two or three weeks of the present time,
and experienced a most trying, exercising season;
for although it appears they were favoured with a
remarkable degree of staidness and resignation,
yet the consideration of what would be best for them,
relative to staying or leaving town, became a close trial.
This will best appear by a letter which I received from your precious son Joseph,
whose conduct during this dispensation of divine Providence,
has been comfortably rejoicing to his friends;
I shall transcribe a part as follows:--"`Eighth month 28th.--Having a short
space of time to spare previous to the gathering of our meeting this morning,
I thought I could do no less than acknowledge the receipt of
your truly affectionate and sympathizing lines.
To be apprised of the remembrance and love of our
friends at such a trying season as the present,
is peculiarly grateful.
Mother also received a letter from aunt Mary Newbold,
expressive of the strong desire of our friends for our retreat from the city;
it was put into her hands just as she was going into select meeting yesterday,
after which we were both at grandfather Bacon's,
and he strongly recommended a compliance with the request.
While we were engaged on the subject,
uncle Jonathan Evans came in and earnestly joined in the same sentiment,
acknowledging he had been some time uneasy about us, and wished much that we were gone.
After all that, the matter seemed to devolve solely upon ourselves,
and mother passed through an afternoon of exercise,
and perhaps I may venture to say I was not altogether void of feeling on the occasion:
no strength was afforded to engage in the business.
Well, dear cousin, I feel it to be a time of uncertainty with us,
and my heart and eyes are frequently afflicted
when I contemplate the scene that is around me;
I now feel more than I have language to express,
so must affectionately bid you for the present, farewell.`"
A note at the bottom of the same letter, says:
"`Since closing the foregoing I went into the house and found mother in bed with a chill,
etc.: if you think it will do,
mention it with caution--thus trials are multiplying fast upon us.`"

While at meeting he began to be unwell himself,
which terminated in the prevailing disorder, and Mary was taken down about the same time,
so that indeed they became a very afflicted family.
But yet they were not forsaken or neglected; the faithful woman who lived with them,
and who did not take the disorder, was very attentive and useful in taking care of them.
Also Edward Garrigues and Nathan A. Smith, evinced on the occasion,
as well as many others during the calamity, a truly Christian tenderness and sympathy,
providing them with nurses, necessary things, and visiting them daily.
Joseph had a pretty smart turn of it,
yet his symptoms were thought to be rather of the more favourable kind;
but cousin Sarah and Mary were severely attacked,--the first
lay several days so low that her recovery seemed doubtful,
and when she arrived to a state of convalescence, she acquired her strength but slowly.
But lovely, innocent Mary--how shall I speak of her!
I feel near sympathy with you on her account, and yet you well know,
that He whose dispensations are all in wisdom,
has a right to dispose of us as he sees fit,
and that when he inclines to take even such as are most near to us, unto himself,
it is rather a cause of rejoicing than of grief.
After struggling with the disorder for several days,
she was taken from a world of temptation, to join, I trust,
the blessed in the realms of purity and love.
We are sweetly confirmed in this persuasion,
in remembering that her conduct and deportment of later time evidenced an improvement,
and that although her disposition was naturally volatile,
her mind was in a great measure kept free from the taints of impurity.
Consonant herewith is the opinion of Thomas Moore, a valuable religious young Englishman,
with whom I understand you were acquainted in England.

Being in company with him at Darby, where he at present sojourns,
our conversation turned upon your family, and speaking of Mary,
he remarked in substance thus, 'As I was sitting with the family,
a short time before I left the city, and observing her innocent deportment and solidity,
it rejoiced me to think she was improving,
and what a comfort she was likely to be to her father on his return.'
An extract from another letter of Joseph's to cousin Rachel Hoskins,
directly after his getting out the first time, I am induced also to transcribe,
as follows:

"`Ninth month 9th.--Having arrived through favour,
at a state of pretty tolerable strength, I feel my mind influenced, I trust,
in best love again to address my dear cousin in this way,
I feel as if I could not enter into a very minute detail of the afflictive dispensation,
which no doubt in the ordering of best wisdom, has, within these two weeks past,
fallen to our lot; indeed I am ready to conclude it is hardly necessary,
as I have but little doubt you have received nearly every particular from
the pens of our truly kind and attentive friends E. Garrigues and N. Smith;
they have been indefatigable in their attention, by visiting us several times in a day,
and in procuring necessaries.
I hope and believe their reward is sure.
I got down stairs last fifth-day,
but was very weak,--have been mending fast ever since--got out this morning to meeting,
being the longest walk I had taken, but find myself not the worse for it.
When I first went out, I think there was not a person to be seen in the street,
and as I passed along my own footsteps sounded solemnly in my ears;
truly I thought that none but those who are actually on the spot could form
an adequate idea of the solemnity of the scene which our distressed,
depopulated city exhibits.
I have also the satisfaction of informing you that dear mother is mending:
yesterday was the first of her being apprised of the death of dear
sister Mary--she bears it with fortitude beyond what we expected;
her weak state would not admit of an earlier discovery.
The day of her decease was the first of my attempting to set up,
and though so weak as to be just able to move a little about the room,
I could not be easy without trying to get down to see her remains--which I effected,
and beheld them decently laid out; her countenance was exceedingly yellow,
but a pleasing innocence was fixed thereon, and an evidence seemed to possess my mind,
that she was taken from the evil to come, and out of the way of many temptations,
into those perpetually abiding habitations, where joy and peace forever dwell; therefore,
what excuse is there for mourning?`"

After cousin Sarah and Joseph had pretty well recovered,
the way opened for the family's coming to this place,
which was accomplished without much difficulty.
Her accustomed meekness and serenity did not forsake her in this time of affliction,
her mind being strengthened and supported by that Almighty Power,
who fails not to be strength in weakness,
and an impregnable fortress to which the righteous may flee,
and find safety in times of trouble; so that she might adopt the language,
(as dear Samuel Emlen told her in my hearing,) "`All
your waves and your billows passed over me.`"

"`21st. fourth-day.--To Peel monthly meeting, where dear George Stacey,
who returned last first-day from Germany,
gave in an account of his travels there with Sarah Harrison, Charity Cook,
and Mary Swett, and he being encouraged to go to the women's meeting,
I felt a liberty to go and set by him: and after he had given in his account there,
I felt a motion to kneel down and return thanks for their preservation,
and to pray that the Almighty might be pleased to protect all his
servants and messengers whom he has sent forth in this land.

"`22nd.--I feel deeply for the inhabitants of this city, and sorrow for them at seasons.
Attended meeting at Westminster with Mary Stacey,
where tears with anguish of soul were my portion;
until a young man kneeled down in supplication, and appeared dipped into my feelings;
and having before apprehended that duty would
fall on me before the conclusion of the meeting,
upon his closing I gave up to it,
and felt enlargement to pray for the inhabitants of this city, for the poor amongst men,
who have no helper but the Lord, and that if it was his pleasure, in unspeakable wisdom,
to humble and bend the sturdy oaks, he may be pleased also thus to manifest his mercy.

"`23rd.--This has been a day of retirement,
in which I have felt a comfortable degree of resignation and quiet;
and in reading the Bible, some passages in Revelations, etc.,
were more opened to my view than ever before.
I trust that in this deep plunging season for many months past,
I have had a degree of fellowship with the sufferers in ages past, such as, David, Job,
Jeremiah, etc., and also with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
and O how I should rejoice in being favoured once more with strength
to go forth and publish with the voice of thanksgiving,
and tell of the wondrous works of the Lord.
This I know the mighty One of Israel can accomplish in me and for me, if it be his will.
But, if it is his pleasure to strip me longer, and that I must yet remain desolate,
sitting on the ground, 'Not my will, but yours be done, O God,' Pardon me,
and cast all my iniquities behind your back.`"

In a letter dated eleventh month 28th, 1798, at London, to his family, he says:

"`Great indeed has been the travail of my soul in secret for six months past.
I could copy many things from my little diary which
would convince my friends that I have not been idle,
and I have thought sometimes if it was my Master's good
pleasure to remove me from my troubles here,
the account of my time spent from day to day would witness for me;
for indeed I have been a mournful Jeremiah in and near London,
and but little can I do but weep, and wait for those days to be over,
and to hear this language, 'It is enough.'
I have not drawn back from any labour which was clearly pointed out in my own land,
neither do I find this charge against me here,
though of late weeks it has been a time of as deep
searching of heart as ever my soul has experienced.
Yet after all, with deep humility I acknowledge I have not been faultless.
What a hard thing it is, when plunged into the deeps, to be content in the will of God.
What a hard thing for the unsubjected will, wit,
and reason of man to become a fool--one of no reputation.
Truly I have thought, my soul never was made so sensible of what the patriarchs,
prophets, and mournful sufferers in their day and generation passed through,
and of the agonizing pangs of Him unto whom the heathen was given for an inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession,
who also gave his cheeks to the smiter, and his face to them that plucked off the hair,
who hid not his face from shame and spitting,
nor withheld his head from the crown of thorns, or his body from the cross;
and all this willingly for our sakes;
unto whom I beg ability to look up in all my struggles and trials.
My soul can say of late with the royal Psalmist, 'O Lord God of my salvation,
I have cried day and night before you; let my prayer come before you;
incline your ear unto my cry: for my soul is full of troubles,
and my life draws nigh unto the grave.
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that has no strength:
free among the dead, like the slain that lay in the grave, whom you remember no more,
and they are cut off by your hand: your hand lays hard upon me,
you have afflicted me with all your waves:
you have put away mine acquaintance far from me, I am shut up; I cannot come forth.'

"`25th, third-day.--Awoke early this morning and arose more calm and quiet,
and I hope truly disposed to say.
Here am I, Lord, send me.
How precious to feel this even for a little moment: how comfortable in the outward,
after a storm of tossing and danger, to experience an easy breeze;
and so it is in a religious sense.
I have had days of tossing and trouble for many months past,
and now if it should consist with the will of the Lord,
to grant me some ease and liberty of spirit, how thankful ought my soul to be.
But it is not for me to judge: if more suffering is best,
I ought likewise to be resigned to say.
Here am I: Your will be done, my heavenly Master.
Keep your tried servant from falling.

"`Attended the quarterly meeting, which was very large;
and to my thankful and humble admiration, much labour fell to my lot;
my heart being opened and enlarged, both in testimony and in supplication.
The business was conducted comfortably, and the meeting ended so.
I felt a change in my situation last evening before I lay down,
and went to bed more calm and comfortable in mind,
when an opening presented of enlargement in the quarterly meeting,
which has now been fulfilled;
also the renewal of a prospect which has for some months been presented to my mind,
and then died away and left me; that is, to visit the prisons of this city.
This prospect seemed so fixed and sealed on my mind,
that I stopped some Friends after meeting,
and laid it before them for their concurrence and help in the arduous work.

"`26th, fourth-day.--Empty and poor this morning, but I desire to be so,
that I may be qualified to render up my will and affections unto my God,
that he may be pleased to guide my feet aright.
I desire ability to say, day by day, Your will be done.
Attended Grace-church street meeting and laboured in testimony.

"`28th.--Spent this evening more lightsome and
comfortable than has often been my experience:
feeling resigned to whatever kind Providence may be pleased to permit; yes,
the cup he gives I am willing to drink.
Lord, bless it, sanctify it, and preserve your servant over and through all.
O preserve me to the end of my days,
and grant that in passing through tribulation and distress here,
I may wash my garments in the blood of the Lamb.

"`29th, seventh-day.--To a meeting appointed for the children of criminals,
at the Philanthropist Reform, there were about one hundred and two.
They were arranged in ranks before me, and stood.
It was an open time, and when I kneeled down in supplication they went down also.
Several of the committee who have the care of them, also the governor,
and the masters who teach the boys their trades, attended, and were kind and respectful.

After the opportunity we went to the girls' apartment,
and had a pretty good time with about fifty of them.
Some were noticed to weep, and I left them relieved in mind.
Dined at Thomas Sturges' with Joseph Smith and Wilson Birkbeck,
who accompanied me in this visit.

"`30th, first-day.--Joseph Smith,
Wilson Birkbeck and Thomas Sturges accompanied me to the House of correction.
Had an opportunity with about fourteen men in a dismal place--however,
it was relieving to my mind: the poor creatures behaved well,
and I was dipped into sympathy with them,
and hope it will prove a time of some profit and encouragement to individuals among them.
Some of them on parting sent their blessing after me.
Went into the women's room and had a satisfactory time with about eight or ten of them;
some of whom appeared tender: from there we stepped into a school for girls,
where there were about fifty, and I had a satisfactory opportunity among them.
After dinner endeavoured to obtain a meeting at the Asylum for poor orphan children,
but failed, and though I felt a great weight and exercise on my spirit on returning home,
as I frequently have done in walking London streets, yet after reading with the family,
I feel pretty comfortable and easy, for which favour I am thankful.

"`31st, second-day; and the last day in the year.
I had a comfortable night, and I awoke and arose so.
But O what a baptism I passed through afterwards! how is it possible to describe it,
except in David's words in the seventy-seventh psalm,
on which I opened in my distress upon taking up the blessed book to read.
O Lord, my soul is bowed down because of oppression.
Remember me and search me--let nothing remain unjudged,
that I may stand before you with acceptance,
and be accounted worthy to promote your cause and truth in the earth.
Help me through my difficulties; wean me from all letting and hindering things.
For your mercy's sake,
grant that I may leave that labour and toil that
has made me to walk uncomfortably in the way,
and lift up my heart to you in faith and confidence,
and give up in all things to do your blessed will,
that so I may yet be found doing your work in my day and generation.
Send forth the covering of your righteousness.
Strip me of all my filthy garments, and clothe your servant with a change of raiment.
You know the unutterable pangs of distress I have passed through for many months past,
and I humbly hope my soul lies prostrate in dust and ashes before you.
Restore unto me peace and comfort.

"`1799, first month 3rd,
fifth-day.--I have had occasion to praise the Lord for ease of spirit this morning;
that is,
if we are to rejoice in ease and quietness of
mind more than in dispensations more trying.
The cloud separates, and a little light spreads.
I desire to receive it with fear and trembling, for baptism, deep baptism is profitable.
Went to the new jail for the county of Surrey,
where I had an open time with about two hundred prisoners, much to the relief of my mind.
Went afterwards to the Clink prison,
where we found only two prisoners--a little arose on my mind for them.`"

In relation to this visit he remarks in a letter of this date.

"`This day accompanied by my kind friends, I visited the prisoners in the new jail:
a most extraordinary building indeed, I suppose we had all sorts, and truly I may say,
such was the love and desire I felt for them when amongst them,
and the enlargement of heart, that I forgot my own troubles,
and how long I had been as it were in the pit.
Tenderness was apparent in some, and a secret hope prevailed in my mind,
that the opportunity would be, at least to some, like bread cast on the waters,
found after many days.`"

He adds,

"`I expect and look for deep labour and travail before
the door will open peacefully to leave this city;
how far I may be engaged in this arduous work, or what will next open,
I feel disposed to leave to Him,
who marvellously leads the blind by a way that they know not,
and in paths they have not seen.`"

"`4th.--Attended the meeting for sufferings.
I am informed that the committee meet with much difficulty to obtain leave for me
to go into the prisons--and no more business can be laid out this week.

"`6th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting,
low in mind but had to labour once more in a close line.
Appointed a public meeting to be held at six o'clock in the evening.
Attended afternoon meeting at two o'clock,
and a little arose on my mind to impart to the youth.
In the appointed meeting, which was large, I was altogether shut up.
Charity Cook preached early, and after a considerable time of silence,
dear George Dillwyn took the service of the meeting entirely off my mind,
and I felt content and easy.

"`10th.--I opened the Bible on Job, sixth chapter,
which is descriptive of my often tried state.
Charity Cook, Mary Swett and Ann Crowley paid me an acceptable visit,
in which my mind was comforted, and its burden a little removed.
Is then faith, even when no more than a grain of mustard seed, able to remove a mountain?
Yes, and it seems as though it was possible to live under the weight of a mountain,
when this little grain is hid out of sight; yet, if it is hid in the heart, it is enough.

"`12th.--A quiet day--a sweet calm spread over my mind while
sitting by the fire side of my kind friend Truman Harford.
I received a note from J. B.,
informing that they will not let me proceed further in visiting prisons.
I received the account with composure of mind, for which I feel thankful.

"`13th, first-day.--Went to Ratcliff meeting and had an open time in testimony.
I was much abased on going to the afternoon meeting, but a solemnity soon spread,
and I bent in supplication in a broken manner, with tears.
I prayed fervently for strength and ability to
drink the remainder of the cup of suffering,
even the dregs of it, in this city, and subscribe to the Lord's will.
M+++.+++ Ransom had a good time after; and before the meeting broke up, I was enlarged,
and much tenderness appeared.
Spent the evening in pleasant conversation, and lay down pretty easy and comfortable.`"

David Sands to Thomas Scattergood

Dublin, First month 2nd, 1799.

Dear Thomas,

My long silence has not been for lack of near sympathy, nor true brotherly love,
as I know of no brother that I am more united to in the bond of gospel fellowship.
Your last letter was the most satisfactory that I ever received from you;
nor do I think it could have been penned more suitably to my then situation.
You mentioned your deep trials,
in which you felt as though you were plunged into the
horrible pit and sunk to the bottom of it.
When I read this part of your letter I was filled with a mixture of sorrow and joy;
sorrow on your account, that your sufferings were so great, and joy on my own,
to find I had the company of so dear a brother,
travelling in a way I thought almost untrodden by any.

I may acknowledge that my trials since in Ireland,
have been like the loosening of new seals of the book of religious experience.
But hitherto I have been helped and carried through every afflictive dispensation,
and am at present in better health of body than when I first landed in Europe,
and find much greater openness amongst people of
every rank than when I first entered Ireland.
I have lately visited most of the towns and places where the
greatest destruction of lives and property occurred,
and found many seeking people, whose former rests appeared to be much shaken,
if not broken up; and with these I have had many refreshing seasons.
Public meetings are generally crowded by the better sort of people,
whose behaviour is very becoming the occasion.
I have also visited most of the families of
Friends where the greatest trials have appeared,
as Carlow, Ballitore, Rathangan, etc., and returned to this city a few days since.
What may open as the line of duty, I do not clearly see at present;
but as i did not visit all the families before I left this city,
I may likely do a little more in that way before I go to the northern parts the nation.

My detention in this land has been very trying to me,
as I seemed exposed to every kind of danger, not only by robbers and murderers,
confusions and tumults of various kinds, but by unfeeling professors,
who have greatly departed from the faith of their worthy forefathers,
and yet desire to be called the children of Abraham:
but I believe my trials of this sort are nearly over,
as many who have been hidden are now made manifest,
and of the more undesigning and simple hearted are favoured to see the snare,
and many have escaped from the wreck,
and I humbly hope all may be gathered into the faith once delivered to the saints,
and the prey be taken from the jaws of the devourer: but this must be the Lord's work,
for none but him can do it.

The general state of society appears to me but low,
yet there are many precious plants in Ireland, and I think their number will increase,
and is now increasing.
Many enquire after you with much affection and love.

I have heard of your late trial in the loss of your dear daughter,
and I believe do sympathize with you in that and other afflictive dispensations,
yet have not the least doubt but all those things that we meet with,
and which may seem little else to our taste than the wormwood and gall,
are but like the strong winds sent to bring the leaky ship to a safe port.
As I remember to have heard dear George Dillwyn say when in America,
to an afflicted Friend,
'Our proper business at such times is to keep the head of the vessel the right way,
and if we did so, we should gain by such dispensations.'
I have not heard much from America respecting the state of our Friends,
that I cannot tell who are removed or who are left,
but have heard of some valuable Friends being removed from works to rewards.
Having given you a sketch of matters,
I conclude in that brotherly love that many waters cannot quench,
and rest your affectionate friend and brother,

David Sands,

"`19th.--Took post chaise and rode to Canterbury to attend the funeral of William Elgar.

"`20th, first-day.--To the burial house,
and accompanied the corpse along the street to the meeting-house,
which was much filled up with the town's people.
Here I met dear Richard Baker, who was pretty largely engaged in the meeting.
Tears were my food in the fore part of it,
and I was glad of the company and help of such a fellow labourer.
Near the close I bent in prayer,
and before the meeting broke up was most easy to appoint a meeting,
although in much weakness, to be held at six o'clock in the evening.
We followed the corpse a long way through the city,
and a pretty long one out of the gate thereof; and a crowd gathered round the grave,
beside Friends, of whom there was a reputable company.
I laboured among them from these expressions; 'Fear God, and give glory to his name,
for the hour of his judgments is come,' etc.
It was a quiet time, to Friends' admiration,
for in former years there had been sad doings,
even to the pulling of ministering Friends down, etc.
I dined at the burial house,
and at the table I prayed that truth might not fall in the streets here;
and also for the son of the deceased, in a particular manner.
Afterward a large number of Friends came in,
and I was favoured with much enlargement of heart in speaking to them.
To the evening meeting, which was an open, solid time, and broke up so.
Supped at our lodgings,
and after it had an opportunity with the gay children of this widow,
who have gone off from Society.
After this day's work feel easy in mind.

"`21st, second-day.--Went to William Patterson's and visited his wife,
who is declining fast; here came Richard Baker, and we were favoured together, I hope,
with the breaking of spiritual bread.
Went again to the house of the deceased, and had a solid opportunity with various Friends.
Set off about one o'clock in a chaise for Dover,
and met a very kind reception from the wife and children of Richard Baker.

"`27th,
first-day.--Set off soon after breakfast in a post chaise with R. H. and Richard Baker,
for Folkstone, where a meeting had been appointed, which was large and solid.
It was comfortable to visit a simple-hearted people,
and it seemed as if they were reluctant to break up meeting and depart.
Dined at W. M.'s, and afterwards had a sweet, refreshing opportunity.
Went back to Richard Baker's, time enough to attend the evening meeting,
which was much crowded, and closed in a solemn manner.
I spent a sweet, refreshing evening after it at Richard Baker's,
where we had a religious opportunity, in which he appeared in testimony,
and I was engaged in supplication, with a thankful heart,
and lay down under this feeling.`"

In a letter addressed to his family, dated 28th of this month,
after informing them of the preceding meetings, he says:

"`Yesterday's labour and the sweet reward annexed, have set me up a little,
and I fervently beg support, not only to the end of this journey,
but to the end of my days,
and that the Lord may have the honour and praise of his own work,
in and by all his dedicated servants and messengers I
hear likewise of the decease of M. B.,
only son of M.,--he has, by account, left great concerns behind.
The last meeting I was at with him at Gilford, about nine or ten months ago,
was a memorable one to me; indeed,
I have often remembered the impression then made on my mind,
and which I had to express concerning some then present.
The uncertainty of visible enjoyments is often uppermost with me in this land, and,
my dwelling has been much, if may so express it, as among the dead.
'Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom you remember no more,
and they are cut off by your hand.
You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness in the deeps.
You have put away mine acquaintance far from me;
you have made me an abomination unto them.
I am shut up, I cannot come forth.'
This was David's experience in his state of affliction;
and I have often read him and Job in the line of experience.
But after all, this is the sum; I think I cannot, I must not,
be without such trying dispensations.
The Lord knows best what is best, and his sovereign, blessed will be done.`"

"`30th.--Attended an appointed meeting held in the town hall at Deal,
The people were slow in coming, and for a considerable time there were but few.
Richard Baker stood in testimony for some time, during which others came in.
Seeing a crowd near the stairs, and feeling love in my heart toward all,
I stood up and with considerable pains got them to come forward, and make way for others,
until at length the house was pretty full; and I was favoured with an open time.
In the afternoon rode to Margate, and met a kind reception at the widow Newby's.

"`31st.--To an appointed meeting in a large assembly room.
Richard Baker had the labour, and my share was in supplication,
and I felt most easy to appoint another at six o'clock in the evening.
It was small, occasioned by a great snow storm,
and I was much shut up for nearly two hours;
but at length had a satisfactory time with such as met.

"`Third month 1st.--J. C. a fisherman and preacher among the Methodists came to see us,
with whom we had some satisfactory conversation: he is a loving, goodly man,
and proposed my having a meeting in their chapel this evening, which I declined.
After meeting last evening, another Methodist preacher came to me,
and I suppose was sensible that I had been disappointed
in not seeing so many people together as I desired,
and wished me not to be discouraged.

"`2nd, seventh-day.---Feeling easy with respect to this place,
I set off in a post chaise for Canterbury, and got to Dover about dusk.

"`11th.--To Folkstone to the burial of John Elgar at eleven o'clock.
The new unfinished meeting house was fitted up with seats, and much crowded.
It proved an open time: several serious soldiers were present.
After dinner I had a remarkable religious opportunity,
in which the builder of the meeting-house was much tendered and reached.
Went to see the parents and children of the deceased, and had a comfortable opportunity.
Walked to the sea side and met with the mayor of the town,
who came to me in a kind manner, and expressed his satisfaction with the meeting,
and said he hoped it would be profitable, especially to the young people;
whose minds were uncultivated.
He is a goodly man.`"

+++_______+++ to Thomas Scattergood

Holdgate, Second month 7th, 1799.

Beloved friend T. S.

"`I trust our love and friendship is founded on a basis that admits of perfect freedom;
and in this persuasion I feel encouraged to address you at this season,
though not without the recollection of having already
demonstrated my continued remembrance of you,
since favoured with a letter from you.
But as the pure cementing union of gospel fellowship, far exceeds all ceremonies,
I shall not attempt much apology for the present mark of freedom,
but in simplicity and sincerity take this method of convincing my endeared friend,
that length of separation, either in distance or time,
has by no means erased him out of my memory,
nor caused any diminution of that love which first united our spirits.
I have, at seasons, felt near love and sympathy with your exercised mind,
so that notwithstanding many have been my own conflicts and probations,
yet I have thought, if it were possible,
I could joyfully take part of your burden on my own shoulder,
that your mind might in some degree be relieved.
I esteem it an unspeakable favour, to feel such a degree of spiritual union,
as to enable in some measure, to dip into fellow feeling with tribulated spirits.

I know nothing that qualifies Christian travellers to
sympathize with the tossed and afflicted,
more than a large degree of suffering themselves; because what we have tasted,
what our hands have handled, we can speak of experimentally.
These, and similar considerations, have at times,
encouraged me to labour after a state of contentment
and endeavour to bear all things patiently,
trying to believe in that blessed assertion; 'All things shall work together for good,
to those that love and fear God.'
The last account of you furnished me with tidings of your
engagement in visiting the prisons in the city of London;
an arduous work for a feeling mind, who is coveting above all things,
the health and salvation of the souls of mankind;
and consequently must be dipped into a state of deep suffering
in feeling the great departure from purity and holiness,
and the degeneracy of the human race.
Oh! what cause is still administered by the deep revolting, backsliding professors,
for the Lord's exercised servants and ministers, to put on the garment of sackcloth,
weeping as between the porch and the altar, interceding with Omnipotence,
for the continuation of his merciful regard towards the workmanship of his holy Hand!

My soul is often bowed in humble contrition,
when I feel the deplorable state of those who are saying,
in the expressive language of conduct,
'We will not have this man to rule over us;'
remembering that the Lord has pleaded in mercy,
not only immediately by the revelation of his own pure Spirit,
but has caused the alarming trumpet to be sounded in Zion by his instruments;
and his judgments for transgressions declared on his holy mountain.

May not the language be adopted, 'What more could the Lord have done for his vineyard?'
Surely he has dealt bountifully with his creature man;
but O how obvious are the returns of ingratitude,
instead of the dedication of the whole heart to
serve the King of kings with perfect obedience.
Are there not those in the present day who can say with the mournful prophet,
'For these things I weep, mine eye runs down with water.'
Though we are made abundantly sensible, that true religion is a heart felt,
individual work;
and that however solicitous we may feel for the spiritual welfare one of another,
it is not possible for any man to redeem his brother,
or give to God a ransom for his soul; yet,
how does the universal love of our heavenly Father,
so abound in the hearts of his disciples,
that they are made willing to spend and be spent,
in calling to repentance and amendment of life.
And if through the efficacy of the Lord's mighty power,
such are made instruments in his holy hand,
to turn one soul unto righteousness and holiness of life,
it will amply compensate for the labour, deep exercises and fiery baptisms,
which I believe accompany all those who are rightly qualified to advocate a
cause dignified with immortality and crowned with eternal life.

Well then, dear friend, may you and I put on strength in the name of the Lord,
and do whatsoever our hands find to do with all our might;
remembering that after having done the will of God,
we have need of patience to receive the promise.
I seem to feel so much of that love to flow in
my heart towards my beloved fellow pilgrim,
which leads to perfect freedom,
that I am almost ready to forget I am writing to a father in Israel.
Doubtless you have heard, before this period,
that my feeble frame has once more been reduced to a state of great weakness,
insomuch that my recovery appeared for a time very doubtful.
During the time of this affliction, my mind was mostly preserved in a state of calmness,
though I felt no great redundancy of heavenly good,
nor sensible feeling of the presence of Him whom my soul loves; but was enabled,
through holy help, to lift up my head, at seasons, in hope,
remembering that I was in the hands of a gracious Creator; and that it became me,
as a dependent servant, patiently to suffer his will, whether in life or death.
After my disorder took a favourable turn, and my strength a little increased,
the situation of my mind became very trying, so as not to be fully expressed in words,
or comprehended by the natural understanding but such a deeply exercised
mind as my endeared friend's may be capable of fathoming in degree,
what I have had to pass through, and in measure, am now wading under; when I tell him,
hope of salvation for mine own soul has hung upon so slender a thread,
that I have been near letting go my confidence;
uttering this language in the secret of my heart, 'Surely my God has forsaken me,
he has hid his face from me.'
O the anguish of my stripped mind,
when not able to put up a single petition for the help of Omnipotence,
nor feel his protecting Arm underneath for my support; instead of this holy confidence,
I was temped to call in question all former experiences
of the Lord's gracious dealings with me,
apprehending I never was commissioned,
nor rightly prepared and qualified to preach the everlasting gospel.
The enemy of my soul's salvation, uses every stratagem to cast down below measure,
and thereby keep from serving the Lord with a cheerful heart, and willing mind.
I believe you can read me in the line of deep experience;
the consideration of which gives liberty for free communication:
for these are mysteries not understood to the full,
only by such as have trod in similar footsteps.`"

"`12th.--Attended the monthly meeting held at the new house, where several goodly people,
beside Friends came, and also two serious soldiers.
It was a sweet time, and these men were very tender.
I had also an open opportunity in the men's meeting.
After dinner the two soldiers came to us,
and we had a precious season with them on parting.
O what tenderness they evinced, and what sweetness and love was to be felt.
The Lord be praised for this manifestation of merciful regard.
Returned to Dover with Richard Baker and Sarah Talbot, in a post chaise,
and was at a meeting appointed by Sarah Talbot.
A few seeking people came in, and much solemnity prevailed;
and now after so many meetings of exertion my bodily powers are broken down,
and my voice much gone, yet the peace I feel is more than a reward for all.
Blessed be the name of the Lord therefor.`"

The following extracts from a letter addressed to Rebecca Jones,
though chiefly a repetition of his engagements, may not be uninteresting:

Thomas Scattergood to Rebecca Jones

Dover, Second month 13th, 1799.

My dear friend,

Although it is some time since you have heard from me in this way,
you may rest assured I have not forgotten you: no, my beloved, sympathizing sister,
you have been as a seal on my heart in labours and travels,
watchings and tears in this land,
and I now feel a little strength and willingness once more to tell you so.

I once entrusted you with some of my painful experience not long before we parted,
by showing some of my daily notes; and may yet inform,
that the same tribulated path has been assigned to your poor brother in this land.
Deep have been the wadings of my soul for months past,
and at seasons I have thought my faith and hope have been tried almost to the uttermost;
but surely underneath must have been the Everlasting Arm,
or else I should have fainted by the way.
I think I have been made sensible of your afflictions at large in Philadelphia,
as well as that portion, which, no doubt in all-wise disposal,
has fallen to the lot of my dear family;
and I have been favoured with so much resignation of mind as to be able to say,
'The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away,
blessed be the name of the Lord;'--and here I am disposed to leave it,
for it has sometimes been almost too much for my thoughts to dwell upon.
'The works of the Lord, they are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden.'

You wilt very likely hear, not only by my letters to my beloved Sarah, but others,
that my mind has been turned to visit the miserable among my fellow creatures,
shut up in prison houses, etc,; and I proceeded as far, in this arduous business,
as way could be procured for me by my kind friends.
As far as I went in the service, it was comfortable to my own mind,
and I have no cause to doubt but that it was productive of some consolation,
at least to some of the visited.
Here once more I was thrown out of business, and in this state my friend Robert Howard,
who, with dear Joseph Gurney Bevan, had been kindly interested in trying to make way,
came to visit me.
When I saw him coming in, the thought arose,
whether he had not found some more work in the jails; but he soon informed me,
that he was going to Canterbury to attend the burial of William Elgar,
the principal Friend in that city, and was disposed to take me with him;
and having had thoughts that there was some further labour assigned me, in that county,
and seeing a little light shine on this movement, I took courage and set off with him,
though under discouragement and depression of mind.
However, through the Lord's goodness, light has continued,
and here in this county of Kent, a new and unforeseen field of service has opened,
very different from that which I was engaged in this time twelve months ago.
I then saw little further than visiting the meetings of Friends,
and only had one amongst others at Folkstone, which was satisfactory.
Now the way has opened in a different line.

The corpse of this Friend was taken to the little meeting-house,
which was pretty much filled up, and we had a long walk to the grave,
through one of the streets of the city.
Numbers who were not Friends followed on the opposite side of the street,
and I rejoiced in having so large a company at the grave.
The people behaved solidly, which I have been informed has often been far otherwise.
Since that, I have had several public meetings at Dover, one at Deal, and two at Margate.

Last first-day I attended the burial of our ancient friend Sarah Beck.
The house was filled up pretty much by the town's people,
and I had a public meeting in the evening,--both favoured seasons.

On second-day went to the burial of John Elgar, Folkstone,
who died of a scrofulous complaint;
and I trust his light afflictions have not only worked for his good,
but have been and will be a blessing to the rest of the family.
Friends are building a new meetinghouse,
and the carpenters were willingly disposed to
fit it up for the accommodation of a meeting;
and some of them, I have heard, said,
all they desired was to be able to get in and occupy
one of the seats they had made for the purpose.
The corpse was put into the ground first,
and afterwards such an eagerness to get into the house I have not often seen;
and it was a large, crowded and good meeting.
The mayor of the town, whom I met with afterwards on the sea shore,
expressed his satisfaction, and said he hoped it would be profitable,
especially to the young people, for they were raw and uncultivated, etc.
There were also several goodly soldiers at meeting.
Yesterday was their monthly meeting at Folkstone--some few of the neighbours attended,
and two soldiers; the latter came to the Friend's house where we dined,
and a memorable opportunity we had with them on parting.
O the sweetness, meekness, and love that was to be felt in their minds,
though to outward appearance mighty men.
Great have been the sympathy and love I have felt for this class of people,
and I should not wonder if they are numbered amongst the first fruits
of a precious visitation approaching toward this favoured island.
The Lord in his infinite love hasten it.

I am now at my dear friend Richard Baker's,
who with his wife are like a father and mother,
and their dear girls as sisters or daughters to me.
Here I stopped, and turning to Richard Baker's two daughters,
told them I was writing to Rebecca Jones.
The girls answered, 'Do give our dear love, and mother, if here would send hers also.
Richard says, 'I have just been thinking of her since dinner,
and I will give you something to insert;
and here I copy it from his memorandum handed me.
"`Richard Baker desires his very dear love to be remembered to Rebecca Jones,
and who frequently has revived in his remembrance profitably,
and wishes her to be informed for her encouragement,
to attend to impressions that may sometimes appear small;
that the single sentence she delivered to him without any comment thereon,
on meeting him in a street,
has been made more profitable to him than some whole volumes he has read, which was this:
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.`"

Pray for me my dear friend, that my head may be kept above water,
and that I may answer the Lord's requirings in this land, whether in further suffering,
or whatever labour may be pointed out!
O this is the breathing desire of your deeply conflicting friend, who loves you.

Thomas Scattergood.

"`14th, fifth-day.--To the week-day meeting at Dover;
towards the close stood up in testimony, and endeavoured to encourage those present.
I appointed a meeting to be held at six o'clock, which was crowded, and a quiet,
solemn time.

"`15th.--Are you able to drink the cup that I drink of,
and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?
They hardly knew whereof they spoke, when they said, 'We are able.'
O the feelings of this hour with my wading soul.
Lord God Almighty, you,
and you alone can enable me to drink the cup with becoming submission and resignation.
Send forth help from your holy sanctuary, and strengthen me out of Zion.
Open the way and go before your servant,
and favour me to accomplish the day's work with the day.
How unsearchable is your wisdom; and your judgments and ways are past finding out.

"`16th.--Paid a sweet visit to the boarding school kept by E. Kelly;
and both mistress and children were much tendered.
After dinner took Richard Baker with me and paid a visit to King, a play actor,
who received me kindly.
E+++.+++ Kelly's husband told me he lay in the barracks near my house in the year 1772.`"

On the 17th he attended a funeral at Canterbury;
and on the 18th went to Rochester and consulted Friends about a meeting at Sheerness.

"`19th.--It seems almost as if the two meetings in view
were as the last handful of meal in the barrel,
and all the little oil left in the cruse Called in and
sat with a Friend whom we found very poorly,
and had a baptizing opportunity in her chamber,
and then accompanied by Dr. Cowper and Richard Baker, went to Sheerness.
We were kindly noticed by several inhabitants,
and the meeting was held in a large and commodious
Methodist meeting-house and proved a favoured time;
the people were open and kind after it--some stopped me and expressed their satisfaction.
I do not learn that there ever was a meeting held here by a Friend before.

"`20th.--Got to Rochester to dinner,
and requested Friends to collect the people of the
place at half past six o'clock in the evening;
which proved a laborious time,
but towards the close more comfort and enlargement were experienced.

"`21st.--The week-day meeting was a comfortable time,
and soon after dinner set off in a post chaise for London.

"`22nd.--Went to Tottenham meeting in a very low state, where was a marriage,
and I went and dined with the company.
After tea the guests were collected into one room, and we had a solemn time,
in which I found some relief by pouring out my soul in supplication and
afterwards had a remarkable tendering season while addressing the children.
It is marvellous to me that it should be so,
and that the water of weakness and great discouragement should
for a moment be turned into the wine of refreshment.

"`23rd.--How blind and stripped I am, and I trust disposed to say, Your will, O Lord,
and not mine be done.
O the mystery of this work, in being thus abased from day to day.

"`Third month 14th, fifth-day.--Feel a secret hope reviving,
that it is right to go to Suffolk quarterly meeting.
After meeting went home with William Dillwyn,
and having received a note from dear John Bevans,
desiring I would come to London this afternoon, S. D. and children went with me.
After conferring with him respecting accompanying me, if I must go further north,
we went into the room to Sarah Talbot and companion, George Stacey, and others, etc.,
and had a sitting,
in which Sarah Shackleton spoke concerning the enemy tempting our Lord to
command that the stones might be made bread to satisfy his hunger;
after which I kneeled down and prayed, and felt some relief.
A prospect was renewed on my mind to have a public meeting at Chelmsford,
of which I desired George Stacey to write to a Friend there.

"`15th.--Set off accompanied by my kind friends William Forster and M. Philips,
and arrived at Chelmsford about five o'clock;
not without a weight of sorrow and exercise, especially on entering the place once more;
however, I endeavoured to bear up and anoint and wash.
Went to the meeting at six o'clock, in a very low state,
in which I had to stand up and labour.
Many soldiers came in: I hope it was a time of some profit.

"`16th.--After two family opportunities, set off for Kelvedon.

"`17th, first-day.--To meeting at Kelvedon, which was small,
and most of the time I felt poor.
Tears of exercise were my food--towards the close, I felt a little opening to labour.
I told them amongst other things, that dear Stephen Crisp, who lived and died here,
had come freshly into remembrance,
and that as a part of his prospects respecting this land had already been fulfilled,
I believed more would be.
I was most easy to appoint a meeting for the inhabitants, to be held at six o'clock,
though in great weakness, and so I attended it.
For nearly an hour after sitting down in this very crowded gathering,
I thought myself never more stripped, but at length in great weakness I stood up,
and it broke up solidly, and the people behaved well.

"`18th.--I move under great strippedness and poverty,
with a great burden of exercise still to carry.
Nothing short of the omnipotent Arm will bring me safely through and over all,
to the end of my days.
Remember your tried servant, O Lord, in mercy, this day,
and let your will be done in and by me.
Concluded to stay monthly meeting in this place.
It was solid, and the business was conducted with sweetness and harmony,
and I ventured to bend in supplication.
Soon after dinner I set off to Dykes Alexander's at Needham.
Here I met with a number of dear friends, and a kind reception from the family.
Went to select meeting and then to see Sarah Harrison,
and had I hope a baptising time in her sick room,
with which she appeared strengthened and comforted.

"`19th.--To quarterly meeting;
W+++.+++ C. appeared early in supplication and afterwards I stood up in testimony;
after dinner had a memorable opportunity with a few friends.

"`20th.--Had a time of weeping and conflict on my bed this morning,
but was favoured to resign myself to divine disposal,
and feel a willingness to go forth as Abraham did, not knowing where,
endeavouring to leave that to the Lord,
to lead and guide me in the midst of the path of judgment.
I trust the upright language of my soul is; 'If you go not with me in this journey,
take me not up from here;' and on the contrary,
if you wilt condescend to the low estate of your servant,
and vouchsafe your good presence, be it unto me according to your word.

"`21st.--To Needham week-day meeting, where I found Sarah Harrison,
and was concerned to pray for the preservation of myself and
fellow servants--dined at William Alexander's. Went to Bury,
eighteen miles.

"`22nd.--In the evening as we entered Godmanchester,
my mare being tied behind our chaise, took fright and turned us over,
and we had a narrow escape with our lives.
I was deeply sensible of it in the time of extremity, when the breathing cry arose,
'Lord save us;' and was favoured to get but little hurt:
when I got into Samuel Blakely's I found my dear friend and companion, John Bevans,
and also met a kind reception from friends.

"`20th.--Went to Leeds, and on the 27th attended York quarterly meeting,
which was a comfortable time.

"`28th.--Was at two sittings of the quarterly meeting, a meeting for worship,
and also a meeting for ministers and elders; which ended satisfactorily,
and I trust I have been in my place.

"`29th.--After a favoured opportunity with a number of Friends set off for York,
and got to Lindley Murray's to a late dinner; here I found Ann Crowley;
had a comfortable, religious time,
and afterwards visited the Retreat and boarding school;
returned to Lindley Murray's and lodged.

"`30th.--Got to Edward Pease's at Darlington about dusk, and met a kind reception.

"`31st, first-day.--Went to meeting and was exercised with the unsettlement of many.
I laboured honestly among them,
and had also a word of consolation for the burden bearers and mourners.
Appointed a meeting to be held at six o'clock, which was very large,
open and satisfactory.

"`Fourth month 1st.--Went to Sunderland, to our friend Solomon Chapman's;
and at six o'clock went to the meeting for ministers and elders.
In the fore part of it I was concerned in prayer,
and afterwards was drawn forth in close testimony.

"`2nd.--Attended the quarterly meeting,
in which I had much labour in an encouraging line to the youth.
The first of this month we drove through snow drifts up
to the hub of the wheels of the post chaise.

"`4th.--Felt openness in supplication at the week-day meeting,
and after it a pointing towards a public meeting, which was held at six o'clock.
It was large and solid.

"`6th.--Got to our friends H. and M. Bragg's before night, at Newcastle.

"`7th, first-day.--To meeting, and sat in a very stripped condition,
but after a time stood up, and had to bear a singular testimony.
Some gay Friends, beside many strangers were present, and I felt openness toward them.
Was not easy without appointing a meeting to be held in the evening at six o'clock.
I went to it in great feebleness, and stood up and laboured for some time,
and to my admiration it was a season of divine favour toward the close,
and great solemnity prevailed after I sat down, and it concluded so.

"`8th.--O my soul, sanctify the name of the Lord, and let him be your fear and dread;
and also seek him for your comfort and consolation.
How shall I go into Scotland amongst a wise people in this poor state,
has often been the language of my mind.
Lord, if you go with me it will be enough--then out of
weakness your strength will be made known.

"`Rode to Shields monthly meeting, eight miles,
with M. Bragg and my companion and had a time of enlargement in speaking.
After dinner had a solid religious opportunity.

"`9th.--Took a walk after breakfast along the sea coast to Teignmouth castle.
Here are the remains of an old abbey; some of the lofty walls are still standing,
and at the end next the sea is a small room very much decorated with carved work.
It seemed as though the images of the apostles were cut out of stone in the ceiling.

"`At seven in the evening attended a meeting held in the Methodist house,
which was a remarkably solid time, and ended so.
It is marvellous to me, and cause of deep thankfulness and encouragement also,
that after feeling so poor this day, and going to meeting so,
fresh strength should be vouchsafed.
The Lord be praised for his goodness.

"`10th.--To the week-day meeting, which was small,
and I felt some encouragement respecting myself.
Bent in supplication, and afterwards endeavoured to encourage a few youthful minds,
and to warn others,
lest by slighting the day of visitation their crowns
should be taken away and be put on the heads of others.
In the afternoon came to Newcastle.
To a large meeting at seven o'clock, in a new Methodist meeting-house;
having had an open, kind invitation to hold it there from three men of that body.
It was solid and quiet, and separated so.

"`11th.--At the week-day meeting I sat nearly or quite two hours in silence,
a part thereof with tears, in viewing my own state;
and yet toward the close a little encouragement was handed forth to this small company.

"`12th.--There appears no opening to move from this place.

"`13th, seventh-day.--In the evening Joseph Clark,
who is a preacher among the Methodists, and in whose house we had a meeting,
came in with one of his friends; they staid and supped,
and afterwards we dropped into silence,
and I was engaged in prayer they appeared to be solid men.

"`14th, first-day.--Received an affectionate letter from Joseph Clark,
enclosing one for Richard Annett, who lives about thirty miles on the way to Scotland.
Went to meeting; many strangers came in, and it proved a tendering time.
The meeting at six o'clock was a full one, and much labour fell upon me,
and it ended in a solid, comfortable manner.

"`15th.--A solid parting time with this family and servants.
Rode thirty-four miles to Alnwick:
on the way a desire was felt that mercy and forbearing kindness may accompany,
and enable me to offer up body and soul into the care of him,
who has helped and supported hitherto in great straits and trials.

"`16th.--Breakfasted with Richard Annett and wife, and had a solid religious opportunity.
Dined at Belford, sixteen miles, and got into Berwick before night.

"`17th.--Got into Haddington, where we lodged.
Soon after we put up a man came, who sent the waiter to call me out,
and said he wanted some conversation with the Quaker gentleman,
and if agreeable would go and bring a brother with him.
Some time after he returned with a young man, and they proposed several questions to us,
which we endeavoured to answer, and were surprised to find them such conscientious men,
from whose outward appearance little or nothing of the kind could be expected.

"`18th.--Arose early and got to our friend George Miller's at Edinburgh, to breakfast.
Went to meeting at ten o'clock, and sat in silence until near the close.
Took a walk through the town, where we were much stared at.
I fear there is too much lack of humility in this city, the metropolis of Scotland.
I felt like a blank this morning in the meeting; and yet apprehended I saw,
and told them so,
that there is a precious seed sown in this place that will not be rooted out.

"`21st, first-day.--A number of strangers came into the meeting this morning.
Dear Elizabeth Wigham uttered a few lively expressions, and said,
perhaps it was necessary for some to experience a further
baptism and refinement to fit for further service.
I was engaged in prayer the latter part of the meeting,
and interceded for myself and those left behind--for the little
remnant planted as a seed in this highly professing city,
and for the inhabitants thereof.
To meeting again at half-past two o'clock,
where dear John Wigham had an instructive time, but all closed up with me.

"`25th.--Attended their monthly meeting, where only about twelve friends were present;
the business was conducted with a good degree of weight.

"`27th, seventh-day.--Attended the select half year's meeting, at which were six members.

"`28th, first-day.--I thought it was a low time at meeting this morning,
but I expressed a few sentences, tending to stir up Friends against they came again.
In the afternoon meeting I was exercised in supplication,
and afterwards appointed a meeting at six o'clock,
which was pretty full and crowded--though there
were lightness and talking in the beginning,
yet afterwards it was quiet, and I had a comfortable relieving time,
and we parted in a solid manner to my joy.

"`29th.--Trust in the Lord, O my soul,
and forget not his benefits bestowed in past seasons.
Trust in the Lord and wait on him, to enable you to do good in your station.
A number of strangers came to the meeting, mostly of the poorer sort,
to whom I felt much love and enlargement.
Friends concluded to adjourn to meet at three o'clock,
when the business was conducted comfortably.
Dear John Wigham expressed his unity with our visit in a very feeling manner,
especially with the silent part of meetings in this place;
and when my certificates were read,
my heart was humbled on remembering the date of
them and how long I have been in this land.
Had an opportunity with the son of A. L. and others in the evening--
another with several convinced people not yet joined in membership;
and on the whole it has been a day of lifting up my head a little in hope.

"`30th.--The half year's meeting having concluded,
I am waiting to see what further is required.
O Lord, remember me according to your good hand upon me.`"

While here he received a letter from his beloved friend Mary Dudley,
from which the following is taken;

Bristol, Fourth month 25th, 1799.

My very dear friend,

Though your last truly valued communications have long laid unacknowledged,
they have been to me not only as a precious memorial of your regard and confidence,
as it respects a friendship which I covet to be so preserved as not to forfeit,
but truly may I say, that, if ever enabled to enter into that sympathy,
where "`deep utters unto deep,
because of the noise of water spouts,`" my soul therein could,
proportionably to its capacity, comprehend your unutterable exercise.
But never, in the midst of all, when beholding you enclosed as in the prison house,
have I been divested of sustaining and consoling hope, that He,
who only can availingly preach deliverance, would bring you forth to His own praise,
and the increasing help of His church and people:
for surely such as are resigned to go down to the sea,
and occupy their business in great waters, will see the goodness of the Lord,
and his wonders in the deep; and then, in renewed deliverance,
are qualified to tell of his love to the inhabitants of His earth,
I was prepared to hear of your enlargement; and though the spirit continues to testify,
that "`bonds and afflictions still await,`" let a poor little sister,
in a measure of these, say to you, my beloved brother, lift up your head in hope, yes,
thank God and take courage, knowing assuredly, there is none like the God of Jeshurun,
who yet makes, and will make the clouds of deep heart-humbling baptism his chariot,
and rides upon the wings of the winds; and this, that His angels may be spirits,
and His ministers a flame of fire.

I wish this to meet you in Edinburgh, therefore forbear entering into some subjects,
whereon I could freely converse with you, through this, or a more desirable medium,
that of personal communion, which I once had a hope I might be again indulged with,
perhaps if able to get to the approaching yearly meeting;
but my very debilitated frame is not likely to be equal to such an exertion,
nor do I yet know, that it would be in the line of duty.
As your feet are once more loosened from the stocks, I hardly expect your return to it,
when such a field as that where you now are, is open to your view.
As I have a particular desire to know whether a
proceedure therein is likely to be your lot,
or the annual solemnity more weightily attractive; I should be gratified,
if by your own acceptable pen (if at liberty to use it,)
you would inform me what your prospect is,
and however or wherever it unfolds, may you, my dear friend, resignedly say,
'Your will be done,' This is a language, which,
though my mind at seasons longs to feel its own,
I may acknowledge to you is a state not attained to; and so great is my weakness,
that even respecting the discoveries of light,
without the present requisition to follow it,
I sometimes fear a turning away or a disposition opposed thereto.
Thus am I often halting, yet here I have been, and am still in bonds,
and in the midst of bodily and mental weakness,
sometimes seeking their being loosened by feeble
endeavours to do the little pointed out.

My friends at home have left me at full liberty for extensive movements,
but I apprehend they will be much circumscribed;
perhaps only a little further into the adjacent counties,
then if strength should be vouchsafed, I have looked westward,
I mean to the western counties, such as Devon, etc.;
but should my health continue as feeble as it now is, rather expect a release,
and liberty to return home,
and perhaps obtain before long a final dismission from further exercise:
what an abundant mercy, if it prove a peaceful retreat.

I think I heard dear John Bevans was your present helper,
to whom I wish to be cordially remembered; we have known each other long,
and have each much to commemorate of abundant mercy,
which having found us in the wilderness, in the land of great drought, has yet preserved;
and thereby hope is revived, that the morning light will be the evening song.
And now my beloved brother, farewell; which I have no doubt you wilt,
in heights and depths, in life and death, yes,
that nothing shall separate from the continuance of divine love and life.
I am your poor little sister, but sympathizing friend, in gospel and affectionate love,

Mary Dudley.

"`Fifth month 2nd, fifth-day.--Went to the week-day meeting,
and in consequence of the half year's meeting having formerly been held at this time,
many people were present.
Several young women were laughing and talking together, with which my mind was grieved,
and after a time I stood up and reproved them,
and told them that my employment in such meetings often was in sorrow and tears;
also mentioned the distress I had been witness to,
when the pestilence that walks in darkness was going through the city where I dwelt;
and how different it would be in this place,
if the Lord should see fit to visit them in the same way,
then they might have to mourn a father or mother, a brother or sister, etc., and say,
Alas! for me.
After I sat down, dear John Wigham had an acceptable time,
and Friends afterwards remarked,
that the meeting at this time never broke up so solidly before.
In the evening I was brought very low,
and retired to my chamber and offered up my prayers and tears,
with strong cries in secret.

"`3rd.--The accuser of the brethren is permitted to come up against me,
and I see no opening to return, and greatly fear going forward unsent.
Your sovereign will, O Lord, be done,
only be pleased to keep the head of your servant above the waters.
Felt more contented and resigned this afternoon and evening.
This is a favour, even to sink down into nothingness, emptiness and poverty,
and bear it in a becoming manner.

"`4th.--I felt a little openness to give liberty
to invite the neighbours to meeting tomorrow.

"`5th, first-day.--Very stripped and poor indeed.
I hope my soul longs in all things to be resigned and content;
and were it not for such prevalent thoughts so continually coming up against me,
(like this,) 'You are deluded, you are deceived,
or it would not be so with you,' I am ready to think I
could sink down and bear all things patiently.
Indeed, it seems as if there was no other way for me,
than to bear this unutterable conflict with patience, and willingness also.
O Lord, you know all things,--you know that my soul desires to love you,
and do and submit to your will.
Went to meeting, and after a time felt an openness in my heart toward the people,
a number of whom came; and although there appeared much lightness at first,
we had a solid meeting, and it concluded so.
I ventured to invite them to come again at six o'clock; which was a full meeting,
and to my humble admiration I was favoured to hold forth the truths of the gospel.
Tenderness and solidity were prevalent; the meeting closed well,
and my soul was measurably filled with thankfulness.
My dear companion on lying down, appeared much broken and tendered,
under the sense that Truth had eminently prevailed in this last meeting.

"`6th.--Comfortable and quiet in mind; but yet under exercise.
Sat down with the family and several Friends,
and felt my mind drawn to supplicate the Almighty Helper to go with us,
and to bless this family; my companion's and my own also were fervently remembered.
Took leave and rode to Queen's ferry, nine miles, and two miles over,
and may record with thankfulness that it has been a sweet ride,
in the fulfilment of that saying; 'For you shall go out with joy,
and be led forth with peace.'
Thanks for this morning's portion--dined at the ferry house,
and put up for the night at Kinross, fifteen miles.
We have George Miller for our guide and companion.

"`7th, third-day.--Rode in the rain to Perth.
To a meeting held at James Fitchey's, where there were about fourteen persons,
and a pretty open time.
A young man who, I was afterwards informed, had drawn back from his profession,
told me after meeting, that he had desires before we met to converse with me,
but his doubts and difficulties had been spoken to, and he was measurably relieved.

"`8th.--A pleasant ride to Dundee, twentytwo miles,
and had a satisfactory meeting with the little company who meet in this place.

"`9th, fifth-day.--Breakfasted with Lewis Evans, where we had a dispute with James Scott,
a preacher among the Glassites, and after he was gone,
a satisfactory opportunity with the man and wife.
It appears he was reached by William Savery.
I went afterwards and had an opportunity with William Smith and wife to satisfaction.
There are four or five men not yet joined in membership,
who hold meetings in this town in the way of Friends.
Got to Montrose, and the ride today has been pleasant: at times we came near the sea,
and before we got into the town we passed over a small river, and then over an island.
Soon after putting up our horses, we took a walk to Mary Mills's and drank tea;
she and her daughter are the only two Friends in town.
Had a religious opportunity,
in which I had a singular communication from that passage concerning the shepherd's
taking two legs and a piece of an ear out of the mouth of the lion, etc.
The situation of Lot in Sodom was also mentioned: in the evening afterwards,
George Miller told me it was strikingly appropriate.
This ancient widow in younger life was zealous,
and frequently walked twelve or fourteen miles to meeting.
She afterwards married unsuitably; her husband failed and brought her into difficulties;
and yet, through it she has been measurably preserved.
I thought there appeared something of the right stamp about her.

"`10th, sixth-day.--Rode to Inverbervey to breakfast.
Dined at Stonehaven and got to Aberdeen, where we put up at an in.

"`11th.--Rode in the rain fourteen miles to Kinmuck,
and met a hearty reception at John Crook's,
and I soon forgot my troubles in this lowly habitation.

"`12th, first-day.--To meeting,
which was filled up pretty soon with well behaved neighbours and Friends,
and my mind was soon sweetened with a sense of the love of God;
and under it I kneeled down in supplication,
and afterwards had an open time in testimony.
I desired Friends to stop when others withdrew, and had a sweet, tendering time with them.
In the beginning of this meeting my mind and prospects were enlarged,
and I felt earnest to move on toward the Orkneys.
My friends and family at home came into view,
and with silent tears I put up my prayers for them, and for my own preservation;
that the Lord Almighty might be pleased to renew the
visitations of his love and mercy to my remaining children,
and I was favoured to believe it would be so Thus the bonds of sorrow,
mourning and death were removed, and my soul given up to do the Lord's blessed will.
O Lord God, you have supported in the deep, and I can say with Jacob,
you were in the place where darkness surrounded, when the stone was my pillow,
when I had hardly faith to believe in your Providence--
sanctified and glorified be your name.
I spent a pleasant afternoon and evening--many Friends called in to see us;
and lay down and rested sweetly in our little berth, which reminded me of a ship's cabin.

"`13th.--Breakfasted at John Morris's,
and called in to see several Friends in their little cabins.
I was particularly interested in an old woman, not a Friend,
whom I observed when she came into the meeting
with a Scotch plaid over her head and shoulders;
she lives in a poor little smoky cabin, without any window in it, and entirely alone,
yet appeared to be happy in her situation.
O, me thought, when a day of searching and trial comes on the land,
when the time arrives which that faithful servant of the Lord, Stephen Crisp speaks of,
when 'they shall go through hard bestead; they shall seek death rather than life,
and not be able to find it;' or in the words of the prophet,
when 'they shall pine away in their iniquities,
and mourn one towards another:' how many would be glad
to be as comfortable as this poor cottager.
It is evident there is such a thing as having the mind
brought into contentment with a very little.
O Lord, in your just anger against pride and high-mindedness,
and the many loudly crying sins which prevail, be pleased to remember mercy.
Rode to Old Meldrum and attended meeting, which was made up of the poorer sort,
and was a laborious time, yet hope to some profit.
In the evening I was closely exercised with desires to be right, to think right,
and act so.
I desire to be favoured simply and singly to attend to opening prospects.

"`14th.--We are told that the snow has not laid on the
mountains so much at this time of the year for seventeen years.
The people at Huntley, where we dined, looked clean and so do those of this town,
(Keith,) where we are to put up for the night.

"`15th.--Took a walk out of town soon after I arose
from my bed and looked over this little place,
I trust in the love of God; and although I felt no opening to have a meeting,
yet there is a pleasant feeling.
I said in my heart this morning,
when will a living army of serious Christians arise and
march through the length and breadth of the land,
from this north country.
I hope there will a precious seed spring up in Scotland.
My mind seems pressed to hasten forward for several days past,
since the way opened to the Orkneys.
To Fochabers near the river Spey.
This has been a nine miles ride of pleasing rural prospects.
We noticed a large hill or mountain, which is the shape of a whale,
with snow on the top and sides; and in the distance mountains of snow were observed.
It has been a very cold ride: we saw a number of hearty looking children,
the little boys dressed in the highland fashion.
The duke of Gordon's seat is near this village,
and on the opposite side of the river are beautiful red rocks.
We got tea and fed our horses at Elgan,
which appears to be an ancient place by the remains of an old cathedral and
a dismal looking prison nearly opposite the window where I write,
and a guard before the door.

"`16th.--Started at six o'clock, and had a very cold ride to Nairn along the bay coast.
Before we got into this little town, and just upon coming to a river,
we met a good looking man, who told us the bridge was not passable with horses;
and after going to the ford with us,
said if we would go to James Brander's inn we would meet with kind attention;
he lived there, and would go over the bridge and meet us, which he did,
and we found he was the landlord.
While at breakfast, inquiring of him concerning the road,
he said he had a good post chaise and two good horses,
and a careful driver acquainted with roads and ferrys part of the way.
We accordingly hired the chaise until our return,
and sent our horses back with John Cruikshank.
Proceeded to Fort George, eleven miles, and the wind being ahead,
it was very tedious crossing at this ferry.
Rode on ten miles to Invergardon, where there is another ferry nearly two miles over.
It was between nine and ten o'clock before we left this place,
there appearing no probability of our being accommodated with lodging, and rode to Tain,
to which we got by twelve o'clock.
The innkeeper and wife and servants got up and met us with pleasant countenances,
apologizing for being in bed.
We got to bed before two o'clock and slept soundly.
This has been a day to be remembered--what but a
sense of duty to the Preserver of my life,
and love to the precious seed in the hearts of my fellow creatures,
could induce me to travel in this manner?
Lord, your encompassing power and providence is every where, grant me strength to say.
Your will be done.

"`17th.--Set off about eleven o'clock, and rode to the ferry, five miles,
but could not get over, and were obliged to return back to our inn.
I felt fatigued and poorly; about seven o'clock went down to the ferry again,
and waited some time before we got over--rode five miles along the coast to Dornoch,
where we got some supper and to bed near twelve o'clock.

"`18th, seventh-day.--This place is pleasantly situated near the sea,
but the houses appear to be fast going to decay.
There are here ruins of an old abbey and steeple house,
the grave yard of which is open and waste,
and it is probable that it was once the seat of a bishop.
About seven and a half miles distant we came to a ferry,
where we had to wait some time for the boat,
and encountered a soaking rain from the neighbouring mountains.
When we got over I stepped into a house filled with smoke,
the fire being in the middle and a hole through the roof for a ventilator.
The pot was over the fire and the poor mother and children around it.
She told me she was a widow and had seven children.
We dined at a public house at Golspie--set off about two o'clock,
and still coasted for about eight miles along the sea,
and stopped at another public house and got tea.
This as well as the last stands open to the sea.
In this ride we passed over a very poor country--the hills are mostly very barren;
and in the valleys where we rode are many huts built entirely of sods.
Some of them are quite humble, but others are in some style in their way,
having a porch or entry with an arch over it.
I counted near fifty of these huts not far distant from each other,
and was at a loss to know how the people live.
I felt for them,
and have thought it probable that in a day to come some young
ministers may be raised up and sent into this poor highland country.
Lord prosper the work, and bring many to the knowledge of your ways,
that so the increase of pure obedience from simple
upright hearts may be offered to your name,
from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same;
and appoint the share of work to your servant in this land,
according to your blessed will, who knows best what is best for me.
The remembrance of precious John Pemberton, whose track we are now in, is sweet.
How different are my feelings here in this land of poverty,
and partaking of barley bread, to what they were in London, where good living abounds.
I look towards you, O London, with a trembling heart.
At eight o'clock we arrived at our inn, but the room being occupied by fishermen,
we took a walk out on the shore.
My mind is calm and resigned, believing I am in my place,
although like a pilgrim and stranger on the earth.

"`19th, first-day.--Arose about six o'clock, and got away about half past seven.
At Burydale, about eight miles, we put up to feed and got our breakfast,
which consisted of a cup of tea, barley and oat bread with eggs.
My companion rather fails this morning, not being able to relish the provisions:
my mind and body seem marvellously supported.
We had to walk most of the way to this place, the road was so very steep and stony.
Just as we got to the inn we saw many people collected,
some appeared to have come a long way, to hear a sermon in the Erse language,
and one after in English.
I felt my mind turned toward them, and after we got in,
George Miller asked me about a meeting,
and I encouraged him to go and speak to the minister,
and he consented to our having the house at three o'clock;
at which time we met with a number of the people to some satisfaction,
but when we got back to our inn, intending to have a cup of tea,
found our room filled up with people,
and nothing could be done but set off another stage; which was a trying one,
having to walk again in the rain, wet and slush:
descended a very steep hill to the river, and found the bridge gone and the water up.
The landlord called from the other side, and told us we could not get over,
but must go back from where we came.
It was trying indeed to think of encountering such difficulties,
faint and tired as we were, at least my companion was so, from loss of sleep, etc.
However, a kind man came to us and told us we might get over,
so we went into the chaise and sat in it until the shower was over,
then our coachman and the kind man who came almost all this day's journey on foot,
took our horses over a large hill, and found a fording for them,
and our guide took us along the side of a very steep and slippery hill,
to a place in the river, where he could take us one by one on his back,
which he kindly did, leaving our chaise behind.
We were content,
and I may say I was glad to get into a house and find I could have a bed to lie upon.
We spent a pleasant evening, and lay down so.

"`20th, second-day.--Arose fresh and well this morning, with a mind resigned, I trust,
to the will of my heavenly Father--what a favour to sleep so sweetly.
In a mile or two we came to another river,
where the bridge had been carried away last winter;
the water was low and my companions had passed it, but I waited to see the carriage over,
and seeing a man coming down the hill with the driver,
I thought it was another poor man who came to assist us; but when he came up to me,
found him to be, by his dress, above the common level in this country.
He was kind in directing to the best ford, and after the chaise was safely over,
he helped me over the rocks in the water,
and desired when we came back that I would call on him,
saying he lived in that house on the hill, pointing to it, which we had noticed before,
as a pretty capital building.
I asked him if he remembered John Pemberton, and found he did,
and when I told him of his death, he appeared affected.

"`We rode about eight miles through a dreary land, and at length we came to Clitha,
a more fertile neighbourhood, and upon enquiring for an inn to put up at,
were directed to a large house near the sea.
When we rode up to the door, a well dressed man came out and told us it was no inn,
neither was there any in the place;
but as we were strangers he desired us to get out of our carriage and come in,
which we did, and he gave us a good dinner.
We had the lovely children called in afterwards, and the servants also;
with whom we had a comfortable opportunity:
on parting we received a kind invitation to call upon our return and lodge,
and have a meeting.
Left this place about four o'clock and rode twelve miles to Wick,
through a barren country indeed;
here we found a town consisting of about one thousand inhabitants.

"`21st, third-day.--Felt poorly, and did not rest so well as usual: however,
my mind was supported and borne up, and disposed to follow on still, in the will of God,
toward the islands.
We were detained until about eleven o'clock, and were on the road until seven;
there was no house to stop at by the way, and a dreary wilderness to pass over,
in which we lost our way.
Put up in the town of Stromness, and were much tried in getting to this place,
the street being so narrow and difficult,
that it was a mercy we did not overset our chaise.
We crossed a tide river at the entrance of this place, and also one last evening;
the tide being down we got over well;
and now my mind is exercised to know how to move and act
according to the divine will having arrived at the land's end.

"`22nd.--Yearly meeting at London, and my mind has been with my friends there.
How differently circumstanced are they--here I am alone
at an inn in the northernmost part of the land.
My companion is gone to see about a place for holding a meeting this evening.
Having caught a cold, I feel poorly and fatigued, and am sunk very low; however,
I believe it was a necessary baptism to prepare for the meeting, which was crowded,
and though very laborious to me, was solid and tender, and ended comfortably;
and we were treated with respect.
We sent for a number of the inhabitants, when we proposed this meeting,
and read my certificates to them, which appeared satisfactory.

"`23rd.--A poorly night--my companions discouraged my going across the water today,
and so concluded to wait.
Took a walk to the water side, and saw women unloading a vessel.
They carry a hundred weight of salt at a time up the shore among the stones bare foot.

"`24th.--Arose and breakfasted sooner than usual.
Our kind landlord accompanied us to the ferry, sometimes walking,
and at others riding behind our carriage.
We had to wait until high water; the wind was north-west,
and our course was nearly north, the distance about twenty miles across.
The boat was about twenty feet long and six or seven wide,
with a little square sail and four men, who rowed us out of the harbour's mouth,
over the breakers, which I believe was trying to all of us;
afterwards they put up the sail and laid our course
until we came near the north point of Ronaldsha;
the men then rowed us across to a small island,
after which we lay our course to Kirkwall.
We were tossing on the water from a quarter past one until near ten o'clock.
One of the ferry men carried us on shore, and we were conducted to James Scarth's inn.

"`When we got into the house we found they were about moving,
and had given up the business, but the woman desired us to wait, and finding her husband,
asked him whether we could not be kept this night;
that although they had sold their beds, they had not been taken away,
nor the bedsteads taken down.
They provided for us comfortably,
and the woman afterwards said that she was
struck with our appearance soon after she saw us,
and thought we were some of Mr. Pemberton's friends,
and she was not easy to let us go away.
This has been a day of trial to my faith.
O how poor I felt after leaving the shore;
and when tossing in the little open boat on the mighty waters,
was ready to question what I was there for;
though before we set off I felt like a simple child, and no anxiety about the voyage,
believing it right to make a beginning in the place we now are.
It was trying to lie and lean in a cramped posture in the bottom of the little boat,
during so many hours, but it being a fine day and cool, it was more tolerable:
my companions were both sick--John Bevans much so, almost all the passage.
I got over my unpleasant feelings soon, and then was favoured with a cheerful, easy mind,

"`25th, seventh-day,--We did not get to bed last night until nearly one o'clock,
and having a cold before, I awoke very stiff and poorly; however,
after breakfast we took a walk through the town,
and were stopped and treated respectfully by several.
The boys as well as some others gathered round to gaze upon us,
as they have done in some other places we have lately passed through.
After dinner I got some sleep while my companions went
out to see about a meeting for tomorrow morning.
They were told by one of the magistrates that we
could not have the town-house until evening,
which is discouraging,.

"`26th, first-day.--A pretty comfortable night,
but felt very low and discouraged this morning; nothing opens, O Lord,
I desire to submit my all to you; I am distressed, undertake for me.
Before dinner William Mansen called to see us, and sat with us some time.
I feel a little opening towards a meeting in the town-house this evening,
and notice is to be given, my companions encouraging it,
and our landlord is friendly and assisting.

"`Drank tea at William Mansen's, and at six o'clock,
my two friends said they would go and open the doors of the house for the people,
but soon returned and told me there was such a crowd in the street
that they feared the house would not contain them by many;
and that they had met with several who proposed our going into the great kirk house.
Our friend William Mansen went with them and got liberty, and a great gathering we had.
It was very laborious for me to speak, my cold so pressed upon me; however,
it was a satisfactory time: we returned and supped with our friend William Mansen,
and the young man who had preached twice in the same house this day was with us;
he appears a modest well behaved person.
Returned to our inn and lodged:
the dear old mother provided me with some drink for my cold,
and the son and daughter are affectionately kind.

"`27th, second-day.--I continue hoarse, and nothing as yet opens,
but am labouring to be content in the will of God, believing I am in my place.
We removed our lodgings from our inn to William Mansen's.

"`28th.--A poorly night,
and very much stripped and divested of any religious prospect this day.

"`29th.--Poor and blind this morning,
and I cannot go forth into work and service unless I feel the Lord
putting me forth--great discouragements come up against me,
and I feel like one broken up.
O Lord, enable your poor servant to say.
Your will, and not mine, be done, however trying my situation may be.
Took up the blessed book and opened on the forty-ninth of Isaiah.
O when shall my soul experience more of the sweet consolations of the gospel?
May I suffer rightly for the seed's sake.
Favour me, gracious God, to do your blessed will on these islands,
whether it be little or more--accept the free will offering of
my lips in a greater or smaller congregation,
and if mortification, stripping and further abasement in poverty is good for me,
grant that my little stock of patience and hope fail not.

"`30th.--Lay down and slept through the night, and felt pretty well upon awaking;
but yet am as a book sealed.
This is indeed a mystery: never did my soul experience such plunges,
such descendings as into the deeps when on religious journeys in America,
and why is it so now!
Hold fast, O my soul, hold fast.
You often remember your humble Lord and Saviour, who suffered for your sake,
and for poor, lost rebellious man's sake.
May I be accounted worthy to suffer in my small measure
for his sake--rather let my hand forget its cunning,
'and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,' than that I
should not be willing to do and suffer the will of my God.
O you all-powerful One, help your servant through; let me not fall in the day of trial,
and so reproach your name and truth.
I desire to love and honour you: enable me to turn away from, and to forget things past,
put them out of remembrance; and reanimate my soul,
if any labour is allotted me on this island.
I believe that you are able to heal and raise up both soul and body;
but if it is your will that I should yet suffer in both, even though you hide the cause,
may my soul sink down and say sincerely before you, Not my will, but yours be done,
O God.

"`31st.--It is a great trial thus to lie still in the house of a stranger.
After breakfast my companions and I took a walk on the hill,
and as I inclined to go by myself they left me.
I walked to the shore, where we landed:
I looked over the wide waters we had crossed this day a
week ago with a degree of awe on my mind,
remembering the preservation we experienced in the boat.
I poured out my tears with strong cries unto the God of my life.
O Lord, for your great mercy's sake, send forth your light--send forth your truth,
and so satisfy my soul, that it may be reanimated and take fresh courage,
to finish your work in this land, so as to feel quietness and peace in returning home.
You who know all things, know what lodges in me; purify my soul and let your will be done.

"`Sixth month 1st, seventh-day.--Wait in patience, O my tribulated soul,
and look up unto your Saviour, whose life was a life of sorrow;
'A man of sorrow and acquainted with grief,'
from whom the sons of men turn away their faces.
O the infidelity and unbelief in the land, and the just punishment due for it.
The wretched state of those that forget God, and how little considered by many.

"`The master of the public grammar school came and breakfasted with us,
and between ten and eleven o'clock we paid a visit to the school; the boys behaved well,
and I have a hope the opportunity will not be forgotten by some at least.
O says my soul, that I might be favoured, through the Lord's assistance,
to sow a little seed on this island, either in the minds of children,
or such who are further advanced in years.
We made an attempt to visit another smaller school of boys,
whose parents are in greater affluence, but the master being a deputy preacher,
was afraid to give liberty.
All our religious acts or duties must be performed in the name of Jesus,
in his power and strength.
If this was waited for by active man, less would be done to appearance,
but what was done would be done to more effect; the Lord will bless his own work.
Not thousands of rams, nor ten thousands of rivers of oil, are what is needed, etc.,
not a great appearance of doing, and saying 'Lord,
Lord;' but doing and suffering the will of God.
This mysterious work is confounding to man's wisdom and activity!
Lord, keep my feet from sliding in slippery places--grant your power,
mercy and love to go with me, that I may move with it, and stay with it.
Is your seed under suffering--is religion low amongst men?
Grant ability to say in sincerity, Where you are, there let your servant be,
even if it is in suffering and death.
In the afternoon felt more ease and composure of mind:
we walked a little out of town to a place where poor children are taught,
but the school was broken up.

"`Went to J. Scarth's and drank tea, our friend William Mansen also accompanying us,
and afterwards we had a religious opportunity;
and way opened to look toward a meeting tomorrow morning,
and we have accepted this kind man's house for the purpose.

"`2nd, first-day.--Feel more light and easy this morning, which is a mercy and favour.
To the little meeting appointed at J. Scarth's there came about twenty,
and we thought it a solid, comfortable time:
after it was over my mind was again turned towards the people at large,
and mentioned my thoughts of having an opportunity at seven o'clock in the large house.
William Mansen sent a note to the parson of the parish to get liberty,
and also desired him to use some means to quiet the boys if they attended.
After dinner, on the opening of the book of prophecy,
some pleasant prospects presented like a mitigation of my deep afflictions, in due time.
Thus the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, thanks therefor;
when I came down stairs, William Mansen showed me a note he received from the priest,
refusing us the place, or his sympathy or assistance.
I felt calm and easy, and all concern was taken away about a meeting,
and thought it was likely the burden might be transferred to him,
and he would more or less feel it, and that good would spring up out of this opposition.
I told my friends I was easy, I thought, without a meeting.
My two companions went out about half past six o'clock,
and found many people gathered in the street,
who by some means had heard there was to be another opportunity in the kirk,
and when they were told it was refused us, they expressed their uneasiness;
they were told that I should be consulted, and they might wait.
I was walking the garden with William Mansen when they returned and told me,
and after a time felt a liberty to go into the street,
and as we passed along encouraged the people to follow.
They appeared much pleased, especially one elderly woman,
who in pretty full terms expressed her satisfaction.
I went upon the steps of the kirk, and the people gathered around,
and after a time had an open opportunity, and then kneeled down and prayed for them.
This last exercise, my companions said, produced much awe over the people,
even the children:
I heard afterward that the people in their houses on
the opposite side of the way heard and were affected.
The company dispersed in a solid manner,
and I returned to my lodgings and spent a comfortable evening.

"`3rd.--Appointed a meeting to be held at seven o'clock
in the town-house for the children of the town,
which was held to satisfaction; a good many others came also--the house notwithstanding,
was not full, in consequence, it was supposed,
of a meeting for catechising children at the Seceders' meeting at six o'clock.
We drank tea at William and Barbara Patterson's, brother and sister of William Mansen's,
with whom, and the mother and sister, we had a sweet, tendering opportunity.

"`4th, third-day.--Applied for the new meeting-house to hold a meeting in,
but it was denied.
In the afternoon visited the family of Hester Richan, wife of William,
who is in the navy; she had her children called, and also servants,
and it was a memorable time; tenderness appeared in the mistress,
children and servants--one of the last description, a young woman, was much affected.
Drank tea with a widow and her two daughters,
one of whom is a teacher of girls in this place,
whose school we visited the other day to satisfaction.

"`Called by the way upon George Boocha and wife;
she hearing of our disappointment of a meeting place, said we should have their house.
On returning home found Mary Mansen, a maiden sister of our friend's,
and in a little time my mind became exercised to speak to her in a particular manner,
and also to the whole of the relations present;
and after supper we had a memorable time with the master of this family, wife,
mother and sister, and after the friends were gone to bed, another with him alone;
he acknowledged that we were sent for his sake--he was much broken and tendered,
and after it I lay down with sweet ease and peace of mind.
O the adorable mercy of God, through Christ his Son.

"`5th.--Awoke and rose pleasant and easy in mind this morning;
though nothing clearly opens, yet I see no way to move from this town.
We meet with disappointments, but trust it will turn to profit in the end.
A young clergyman, who lives about five miles off, came and dined with us;
at half past six o'clock went to meeting in the town-house,
which was filled up with people.
They were long in coming--the poorer came first,
and did not behave so soberly as could be wished,
and I had to stand up under great disadvantage, like working through a cloud of darkness,
lightness and chaffiness; but thanks be to the Lord, who gave strength,
and it proved a marvellous time.
I think in all the testimonies I have been strengthened to bear in public,
the state of priests and false teachers never was more clearly opened to my view,
and strength was given me to declare it,
and I find since that the nail was hit on the head.
My mind was calm and easy after it.

"`6th, fifth-day.--Quiet and easy in mind, though with aches and pains of body;
for before the meeting yesterday, my body suffered in measure like one going;
to be laid on a bed of sickness.
Lord, favour with strength in the time of need, the time of deep trial,
whether this day or in a day to come; whether inwardly or outwardly, or both united.
Favour me in the season when the adversary may be
permitted to come in like a flood with discouragements,
bringing a cloud of death and darkness with him.
O Lord, you have favoured me hitherto--shelter and protect still; and your will be done.
My companions having heard that the Antiburgher preacher had spoken
against me and the doctrine I was concerned to hold forth,
and had given us a challenge to meet and dispute with him before the people,
and afterward sent a note, desiring a conference with me or all of us;
I requested my friends to go and tell him,
I was willing to meet him in their large meeting-house
and invite all the inhabitants of the place;
but this has been declined by him.
At six o'clock we had another large meeting in the town-house, to satisfaction,
and in the close I took the liberty to mention what had
passed between the above mentioned preacher and us,
who are strangers;
and that we were not afraid or ashamed to meet him and the people at large,
and give an account of the hope that is in us.
We drank tea with Casper Thrails, the old justice,
and had a little religious opportunity; his wife appears to be a solid woman,
and some of the children and grand-children are hopeful.

"`7th, sixth-day.--I know not but I am fully clear of this place;
having laboured fervently among them.
May the Lord bless it and raise up a seed to the praise of his name,
in this town of Kirkwall, which shall branch forth and spread to other islands hereaway,
says my soul.
We were busily employed until about one o'clock in preparing for a move,
and sat down with William Mansen's family and had a comfortable parting time.
I felt an opening to kneel down and pray for this family and the inhabitants universally.
The dear old woman, our hostess, and her sister, and I think the servants,
also followed the example, and went down on their knees, and after it we parted sweetly.
We had a message from Hester Richan,
desiring we would call and see her on the way out of town.
She had a table spread with coffee, etc., to refresh us,
which with the kindness of several in the streets,
who seemed disposed to send a blessing after us, was grateful.
S+++.+++ Mansen and her niece, with most of Hester Richan's children,
accompanied us some distance out of town.
We walked about three miles to William Lindsay's, an ancient man,
who kindly noticed dear John Pemberton:
here we refreshed ourselves with provisions which William Mansen's wife had put up,
and proceeded toward Stromness, about twelve rniles further.
We had hired a man and a horse with a little cart,
and expected he would take one of us in it, beside our luggage,
but our kind friend Hester Richan had provided a little Shetland pony,
which I rode most of the way.
William Lindsay provided one horse, and we hired another: it proved a rainy afternoon,
but before night we got into pretty comfortable quarters.

"`8th.--Walked up the hill with our landlord after breakfast,
and saw the large mountain of Hoy, the Western ocean and the mouth of the harbour.
The harbour is a very fine one indeed,
which is amongst the numerous blessings of Providence
to seafaring men in this northern clime.
A person named Geddes came and dined with us,
who is a brother to captain Geddes of Philadelphia:
he has procured a meeting place for us,
and while my companions are gone to see the parson, I have sallied out along the coast,
and am now sitting on a rock opposite to the great mountain over the Firth,
and open to the bay and Western ocean.

"`Dear Philadelphia comes up into view, and the prospect of embarking looks pleasant.
O Father of mercies, who have led me about for years in this land,
wilt you indeed waft me safely over the deeps?
Wilt you be my protector and preserver?
My soul craves ability to believe and trust in the sufficiency of your power and love.
How warming and comfortable is the outward sun,
now shining on my feeble body,--how pleasant also the gentle breeze from the sea.
O for the shining forth of the Sun of Righteousness--O
for the quickening virtue that proceeds from you,
you everlasting Fountain of all good.
In walking along the shore, I saw men gathering weed to make kelp,
the lads catching fish, and women collecting shellfish from the rocks, and I said,
how good is the Lord to the inhabitants of this island,
in so bountifully providing for their needs.
I have viewed the rapid tide and great swelling of the sea meeting it,
and have said in my heart; How wonderful and manifold are your works, O God;
in wisdom have you made them all.
I am comfortable in your presence: thanks, thanks be unto you.

"`Attended a meeting held in a ware-house: it was pretty large,
and although most of the people had to stand, it was solid for the most part,
and ended well.

"`9th, first-day.--Felt fatigued and propose resting until evening,
when there is another meeting appointed.
Found no opening to any meeting this morning, and spent it quietly at the inn.
After dinner took a walk along the coast to the ruins of an old kirk and burial ground,
where they now inter the dead.
I was instructed, and feel a sweet and quiet mind.
Drank tea at David Geddes',
and at half past six o'clock went to meeting in the ware-house.
It was very large and proved an open, tendering, and I trust instructive time;
had a pretty full opportunity with William Mansen,
and did not get to bed until near twelve o'clock.

"`10th, second-day.--About seven o'clock set off in a small boat with four men;
it being a fine day, came around the Hoy,
which is in the Western ocean,--saw a rock called the Man of Hoy;
in one position it looked much like a large and high chimney;
and in another it appeared like a giant, standing in an erect posture,
and we could discern some resemblance to a head and features.
We were until half past two o'clock in crossing,
and it was called by the boatmen an easy passage.
My companion was very sick:
I feel thankful for the preservation back to Caithness and for an easy mind,
and I trust nothing has been left undone which was commanded me to do.

"`Went to meeting at seven o'clock, which was not so large as the former one,
and there was much unsettlement for a time;
but on the whole it afforded peace to my mind.
When will the day arrive,
in which the people will be livingly convinced and settled on the ancient foundation?
Many are tender and loving, and some appear satisfied,
and yet in some places take but little notice of us afterward,
so we are necessitated to leave them and trust to the Lord.

"`11th.--Set off between nine and ten o'clock.
P+++.+++ Swannis came and breakfasted with us,
to whom we endeavoured to explain our principles and views respecting the Lord's supper:
he appeal's a good man.
Our kind host accompanied us over the river on our way.
We had a pleasant ride to Wisk, twenty miles, and found a great alteration in the roads;
yet vegetation appears backward, the grain just coming up, very little grass for cattle,
and snow on the mountains yet visible; and I noticed at Kirkwall,
that the currants were just forming on the bushes.
In consequence of fatigue I was sick on the way this morning, but enjoy an easy mind:
dined at Wisk--wrote to E. Elmsley to send our horses to Clythe,
and were kindly taken in by our friend Benjamin Henderson.
I was much overdone, having had very little appetite for days past.

"`12th.--Collected the neighbours together about ten o'clock,
and had a satisfactory meeting in Benjamin Henderson's malt house,
and afterwards rode about six miles to John Reid's,
the friendly man who so kindly invited me to call and see him on our way back.
Here we met a kind reception from his wife and her sister,
and spent the evening with them agreeably.

"`13th.--Had a sitting with this family and parted with affection.
Rode on to Berydeal, a place where we had a meeting, and found when we came to our inn,
that the landlord lay a corpse.
There was very little water to interrupt our crossing Dunbeath, for we walked over it.
We rode and walked across the Ord of Caithness mountain; when we got to the ford,
about one mile from Helmsdale, found the tide up,
and left our man and carriage to wait and come after us when the tide was down.
We walked on, and our landlord took us in kindly,
but had no great variety of provisions for us;
but with the help of some butter we brought from Thursa, we made out,
and I feel much better after my fatiguing walk today.

"`14th.--Started pretty early and breakfasted on the way,--crossed
two ferries and arrived at Tain between nine and ten o'clock.
This has been a fatiguing day, and trying to our spirits;
weariness of body seems to affect the mind also,
but my soul craves ability to hold fast through all that is to be met with.

"`15th.--Arose early in order to go one stage further this day.
I see nothing,
and feel nothing for several days past with respect to holding meetings for the people;
and am content.
There is much snow yet on the mountains at a distance,
but the fruit trees are in blossom in the gardens.
The grass is about six inches long, and one field of wheat about six or eight inches up.
After crossing Cromaties' ferry, and Fort George ferry,
we reached Nairn about eleven o'clock,
and put up with the person from whom we hired the carriage, who received us kindly.

"`16th, first-day.--Feel much recruited with a night's rest,
and thankful for favours received.
The last has truly been a week of toil and fatigue to body and mind.
O for the continuation of the waters of purification and cleansing for us all;
that as a little band we may be favoured to say,
It is good we gave up to this piece of religious duty.
A quiet pause this morning after breakfast, while my companions were writing,
wherein my faith and confidence in the divine Arm were renewed,
for which I feel thankful, and for all the mercies received of the Lord.
My mind is still turned towards England and home, but in the Lord's time, not mine.
We took our chaise and driver on to Elgin, and had comfortable lodgings.

"`17th.--Went with the chaise to the ferry opposite to Fochabers, and there left it:
passed over the river and walked near a mile, the driver carrying our luggage.
Here we settled with him and hired a chaise to go forward to Keith, where we dined;
and there being no likelihood of our getting beds, we went on to Huntley,
and were kindly taken in.

"`18th, third-day.--I took a lonely walk to an old castle, and spent about an hour,
in which a good degree of sweetness covered my mind.
Philadelphia came freshly into view, and my prayers were put up for her.
I thought how many innocent persons had been cut off in
her borders within these seven years of distress;
and a secret craving arose in my soul,
that it might please the Lord for the present to accept their lives, in some degree,
as a sacrifice for others,
and try the inhabitants a little longer with the
enjoyment of health and the blessings attending it,
as in years past.
I thought also of the state of the nations of Europe,
and how the dragon's chain is loosened; what wars and desolations prevail,
and what a torrent of blood has been spilt.
O poor England,
is your day yet to come! you who have contributed so much fuel to this fire.
Through all this, my soul has beheld, this day,
that the glory of the Lord shall be seen to shine through and over all these shakings.
I have seen that the Lamb's war will go forward in the earth,
after the dragon and his cruel war--the one being for the destruction of men's lives,
the other not only for the saving of the precious soul, but also for the body.
Lord, hasten the coming of this glorious, peaceful day and dispensation,
if it be your blessed will.
As our horses had not come, we got dinner at this comfortable inn,
and parted from the goodly women who kept it:
took tea at Old Meldrum and arrived at John Cruikshank's before night,
and met a kind reception.

"`19th.--To the week-day meeting, which, towards the close, was a tendering season.
After dining at our kind old friend John Cruikshank's, at Kinmuck,
we had a religious opportunity in the family, and called by the way at Amos Wigham's,
and here we also had a sitting with the family.

"`20th.--To Old Meldrum to monthly meeting, where my heart was humbled,
and I was brought on my knees in supplication, and afterwards engaged in testimony:
got to Aberdeen, seventeen miles, about dusk, and put up at an inn.

"`21st.--Rode thirty-seven miles to Montrose: took breakfast at Stonehaven,
near which is Ury, the seat of Robert Barclay.
We saw his house and the family burial ground from a hill, soon after leaving this place.
Weary on getting in this evening, but find the people kind.

"`22nd, seventh-day.--Proceeded to Dundee, twenty-nine miles; and after getting in,
Lewis Evans and William Smith called to see us,
and we appointed a meeting to be held in the morning at the Tradesman Hall.

"`23rd, first-day.--Went to the meeting, which was held opposite our inn,
in Tradesman Hall, and trust it was to some profit.
Saw no opening to any other in the evening, though some expected and desired it.
Left the place about three o'clock, and rode to Perth, twenty miles.
Lewis Evans and William Smith accompanied us, and after supper had them and together,
and hope that a long subsisting difference was in good degree healed.

"`24th.--Started about eight o'clock, and rode fifteen miles to an inn and dined;
I feel easy in thus moving on, which is a favour.
We had a long ride of forty miles today; crossed Queen's ferry, and I walked up the hill,
and felt so little tired I thought I could have walked the last stage of ten miles.
On getting to George Miller's at Edinburgh, I received several letters from my friends,
but none from America--it seems that some have gone to the Orkneys for me.

"`25th, third-day.--An exercising day,
and could see no opening to any religious service in this city.

"`26th.--Set off after dinner, having Andrew Reid for a guide,
and Joseph and Margaret Flintoff of Manchester, in company:
stopped at Haddington and took tea, and lodged at Dunbar,
where it was with some difficulty we got accommodated.

"`27th.--Got to Berwick and lodged; sighing and tears were my portion this day,
and I left my companions after dinner, and walked several miles in great thoughtfulness.

"`28th.--A refreshing night's sleep,
and awoke with a degree of sweetness in remembering God.
Went on fifteen miles towards Belford:
I lagged behind my company and felt very pensive--going
home came up with weight--also my wife,
connexions and friends in America.
My cry to the God of my life was for right direction and resignation.
I looked at the labours of dear Sarah Lynes as we left the place this morning,
and at Holy Isle, where she went, and other places also, but all was closed up to me;
yet I endeavoured to stand open and resigned to religious duty, when it may present:
O my soul, trust in God.

"`29th.--We lodged at Alnwick, and were comfortably entertained.
This morning's ride of nine miles has been with weeping and tears.
We arrived at H. Bragg's at Newcastle, before night, and met a kind reception.

"`30th.--After dinner I received letters which had gone to Kirkenwall,
two of which were from my son.
Attended the afternoon meeting, under great pressure of soul,
and prostrated myself in prayer, and afterwards had some communication,
particularly to the youth.
Laboured to bear up in the midst of company who drank tea with us,
and felt more relieved and easy on lying down; my faith being renewed in God.

"`Seventh month 1st,
second-day.--A comfortable degree of faith and confidence vouchsafed,
which calmed my mmd on arising.
I crave this blessing at the hand of my God,
to be favoured to centre and resign my will to his will: it is the Lord,
let him do what seems him good.
If he has pleasure in me, I shall yet see the ark of his strength and his holy habitation.
Had a pleasant ride to Durham: put up at an inn not far from meeting,
and at six o'clock attended the quarterly meeting for ministers and elders,
which was open and baptizing beyond my expectation, and my soul was humbled.

"`2nd, third-day.--The quarterly meeting was a remarkably open time,
both in that for worship and also for discipline: dined at the inn with many Friends,
and had a tendering time afterward.
Parted with my dear friends H. and M. Bragg, with much affection,
and accompanied by B. Pease and others rode to Darlington, eighteen miles,
and felt fatigued with this day's exercise.

"`3rd.--Made several visits to Friends, and had two religious opportunities.

"`4th.--To a pretty large meeting held in an assembly room: it was open and comfortable,
after which we proceeded about twenty-three miles on the way to Ackworth.

"`5th, sixth-day.--Proceeded on our journey, and the weather being warm, I was fatigued,
but feel, I hope in the line of duty, in moving on towards Ackworth, where we arrived,
and had an opportunity with the boys after supper.

"`7th, first-day.--An open time at meeting this morning, and after dinner went to Leeds,
to an appointed meeting at six o'clock, which was very large and an open time.
Lodged at Joseph Jewitt's, and was very kindly noticed and cared for.
Returned to Ackworth,
and on sixth-day evening one of the lads read a portion in Sewel's History,
and closed with that memorable epistle of Francis Howgill to his friends,
in which he opened his prospects respecting the people he had made profession among.
1 had a little to communicate after it,
and proposed to the boys that the next evening
this excellent epistle should be read again;
and on seventh-day evening we began with reading it.
Jonathan Binns, the oldest son of the superintendent, read it in a feeling manner,
and it was a memorable time: we went also among the girls,
and one of the mistresses read the same,
but was obliged to stop for tenderness of mind,--this was also a favoured opportunity.

"`8th.--Rode to Settle, forty-two miles, which we reached about dusk,
and were kindly taken in by John and Mary Birkbeck.

"`9th.--Proceeded and got to Lancaster,
time enough to attend the select meeting at five o'clock; here I met with Martha Routh,
Deborah Braithwaite and sister Sarah.
It was a searching meeting.

"`10th.--To the quarterly meeting, in which I was largely engaged, I hope to some profit.
The meeting adjourned to afternoon, and ended solidly.

"`11th.--Staid the week-day meeting, and was again largely exercised in testimony,
and appointed a meeting at six o'clock in the evening: dined at W. Jessop's,
and had a singular time after dinner with a number of youth.
A tender young man came also to pour his afflictions into my bosom.
The meeting was a very trying one; it seemed to me, much of the time,
like fighting with beasts at Ephesus, of which Paul speaks.
I was much distressed: one tender woman, however, came to me after the meeting broke up,
which was some consolation.

"`12th.--Arose this morning with desires to push on,
trusting in the arm of all-sufficient strength to support in further trials.
We had Samuel Fielding for a guide,
the young man who kindly accompanied me before
when I set out from this place for Sheffield.
We got to Preston about five o'clock, and notice was given of a meeting at seven,
which was pretty large and satisfactory.
I stopped the little company of Friends after it, and had another tendering time.

"`13th.--Rode thirty-two miles to Liverpool, and got into Robert Benson's in good time:
here we found Sarah Harrison, Christiana Hustler and daughter, etc.
Met with a very kind reception from my dear friends Robert and S. Benson.

"`14th, first-day.--To meeting, and for the first time,
had my mouth opened in public in this place.
It was a pretty relieving time, and at the close I appointed a meeting at six o'clock,
which was well attended, and I was largely exercised in testimony,
on the necessity of being prepared for death.

"`16th.--Attended the monthly meeting, where a share of labour fell to my lot.
After dinner went with Sarah Harrison and John Hall to
the vessel in which they think of embarking,
and with Martha Routh, Christiana Hustler, my companion, and several others,
we had a solid time.
I knelt in prayer for them, that the good hand might go with them,
who were set at liberty, and preserve my life in this land,
if a portion of the bitter cup is yet to be drank.
Dear Martha Routh spoke encouragingly to me respecting my bonds being broken.

"`18th.--To meeting, where several testimonies were borne,
but I was shut up in silent exercise and conflict.`"

The following is taken from a letter received from his friend Ann Crowley, dated:

Shillingford, Seventh month 18th, 1799.

My mind has been so much with my beloved friend's exercised spirit of late,
that it seems as if I could scarcely forbear, in sisterly freedom, testifying the same,
with the heartfelt expression of continued love and sympathy.

From the information received a day or two back,
it appears uncertain whether any communication of this
sort may reach your hands this side the Atlantic;
but as I am well aware,
travellers are often detained longer than they may at first expect,
shall venture to send one more letter,
acknowledging the receipt of your kind testimonials of
continued affectionate remembrance;
both which came safe to hand, and met a welcome reception.
I renewedly thought the comparison of the wise man was indeed just; 'Words fitly spoken,
are like apples of gold in pictures of silver,' so valuable and precious.
May the God and Father of all our mercies, favour with an increase of living,
saving faith, to believe the encouraging language administered in the needful time;
for verily, my beloved friend, I can assure you,
your expressions were so well adapted to the state of my mind,
that I could say of a truth, Deep utters unto deep.
Oh! the blessed privileges true gospel ministers possess;
my mind is bowed at this very season,
under a fresh sense thereof--these are made present in spirit, though absent in body;
can feel the suffering state of exercised mourners in Zion,
and dip into sympathy with such, under their probations, and thereby are often enabled,
in the wisdom of Truth, to hand forth words in due season,
which so effectually reach the witness, as to raise this acknowledgment,
'It is the Lord's doings, and marvellous in mine eyes.'
I have had frequent cause to adopt this language,
and admire the mercy and goodness of a kind Benefactor,
who has liberally conveyed counsel and encouragement,
through the medium of his chosen servants,
when they have known nothing of my mournful state, but by the revelation of divine light.
These are favours that loudly call for perfect
dedication of heart to the noblest of causes,
even that which is dignified with immortality and crowned with eternal life.
I feel renewed desires raised in my soul, that a fresh supply of those heavenly gifts,
which only can qualify for the Lord's work, may be mercifully granted,
that the remainder of my days may be employed to his honour;
who is worthy of all praise and adoration, forever and ever.
Amen.

I heard, a few days back,
my endeared friend has a prospect of a speedy release from further service in this land:
the thought of your departure, without the privilege of another personal interview,
feels trying; nevertheless,
if your great and good Master is pleased to liberate your deeply exercised spirit,
from the conflicts and trials which have fallen to your lot in this land,
and set you at liberty to return once more to beloved relatives,
my heart can feelingly say,
'Loose him and let him go:' and may the God of all grace and consolation go with you;
crowning your labour of love with that peace and joy, which man by nature knows not of.
Your exemplary patience and resignation under the proving,
trying dispensations allotted by unerring wisdom, for wise purposes,
hid from the natural understanding, have been, and will I trust, remain to be,
lessons of deep instruction to my frequently discouraged mind; and I am bold to say,
from what I feel, that many have abundant cause to acknowledge with myself,
that it has indeed been good for us,
that we were mercifully favoured with your instructive,
edifying company,--it has often preached the loudest language words can set forth.

It is likely my beloved friend will have heard before this reaches his hands,
that I have parted with my credentials,
and am for the present set a little at liberty from the
arduous engagement of visiting the churches.
It was no small exercise to my mind before a final conclusion took place;
many fears presented lest I should be unwisely, in the will of the creature,
drawing my shoulders from the burden, and my hand from the work assigned;
but with deep humility and thankfulness of heart I can say,
peace has been the clothing of my mind since the determination;
and this language sweetly arose in my heart on reaching my home, 'Return unto your rest,
O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.'

The last account I received from my late beloved companion P. S.,
her health was somewhat improved;
a Friend from York monthly meeting has obtained a certificate to unite in further
service,--I trust it will prove satisfactory and relieving to them both;
and that my dear friend, and late fellow traveller,
will be enabled to complete her visit of love to Friends of this nation,
to her own solid comfort and peace,
and to the edification of the churches where her lot may be cast.
I am comforted in believing she is provided with
a friend more capable of assisting her many ways,
than I had ability for; but I trust I endeavoured to do my best,
though conscious of having lacked, through the prevalence of much weakness,
both of body and mind.
Though my body is now exempt from the constant fatigue of travelling,
my mind continues in daily exercise,
and perhaps never more deeply dipped into a secret engagement of heart for poor Zion;
being sensible her ways mourn,
because so few come up with holy dignity to her solemn feasts.
Please to accept of as much love and sympathy as you can,
from one who sincerely covets your preservation, comfort and peace,
both in time and eternity; your friend and exercised, poor sister,
says farewell in the Lord; so be it says my soul,

Ann Crowley.

"`21st, first-day.--I had considerable labour in meeting today,
to stir Friends up to a sense of duty,
especially that of diligently attending week-day meetings.
Put off the afternoon meeting until six o'clock; which was largely attended,
and a very laborious time to me.
I had to remind them of the grave, and to declare against atheism and deism;
returned home heavy, not having obtained that relief which my soul longs for.

"`22nd, second-day.--After an opportunity with this large family and other Friends,
I took leave, and got to our friend John Bludwick's a little after five o'clock,
and at six went to a public meeting.
It was laborious to me, feeling unwell and fatigued in body, and low and tried in mind.

"`23rd.--To meeting at ten o'clock, and was soon broken into tears of contrition,
in contemplating the Lord's dealings with me.
I wept, and said in my heart, I desire to trust you still, my Lord and Master;
and afterwards stood up with a tendering testimony, which I hope was to profit,
feeling nearly united to a tender remnant; some of whom, I trust,
are among the beloved youth.
When will my bonds be broken, and my captive soul set at liberty; wait on your God,
who is all-seeing and merciful.
Rode to Manchester after dinner, accompanied by Samuel Forster,
and put up at R. Routh's. John Thorp came and spent the evening pleasantly with us,
and I felt cheerful.

"`24th.--Went to meeting and sat two hours in silent poverty,
and after it had a pretty tendering time.

"`25th.--After a wet ride of twenty-five miles we got into Huddersfield.

"`26th.--Rode about three miles with my kind companion John Bevans, and then we parted,
urgent business calling him home.

"`28th, first-day.--Attended morning and afternoon meetings at Ackworth,
which were comfortable times, I hope to most or all; and in the course of the evening,
after a portion of scripture was read to the boys and girls,
I had a time in testimony and supplication.`"

From the 28th of the seventh month to the 4th of
the ninth month he remained at Ackworth school,
seeing no clear opening into any other service.
From his daily notes during that period,
he appears to have been very constantly occupied in attending upon the scholars,
with whom he had many tendering religious opportunities.
His labours of love, and kind advice and sympathy,
with those who had charge of that institution, were strengthening and acceptable to them.
Under date of eighth month 21st, he wrote as follows;
which appears to be a summary of his labours there, both before and after that date.

"`Eighth month 21st,
fourth-day.--It is now more than five years and three months
since I have seen my place of abode in Philadelphia,
or my parent, wife and children.
Many painful days and wearisome nights have I passed through in this land.
I awoke this morning with greater quietness and
sweetness of mind than frequently has been the case,
and in this humble, quiet frame, my will was resigned up to the divine will.
I have spent some weeks in this place,
and do not know that there has been so much health of body experienced,
for the same length of time, in this land.
I have visited the schools almost daily,
and have taken delight (at least as much so as my exercised state of mind would
bear) in instructing some of the children in reading and writing--have played with
them a little at times--mixed with the boys and girls in their walks in the yard,
in pleasant conversation, and also been favoured with tendering religious opportunities,
not only in meetings, but in the collecting rooms.

"`When I view my situation, when I consider the distance I am from home,
how long I have been absent, the afflictions I have passed through,
and also those of my family, especially this time twelve months ago,
with the pestilence invading their dwellings and taking off my
precious daughter--my companion in life reduced to a low state,
by complicated trials in this long absence--a dear mother nearly eighty years old,
and in a childish state;--my heart has been sometimes almost overwhelmed.
I hastened from Scotland to be ready, if any opening presented, to go home;
but here I am yet, as a prisoner in bonds, and I humbly hope, resigned to my allotment.
Often have I been in distress unutterable; and I thank my God, my helper and preserver,
for support hitherto, and for so much ease and quiet of mind in the present moment.
And now seeing no way opens with clearness to leave this land, what can such a poor,
abased servant do, but with humility acknowledge,
that great and marvellous are your works.
Lord God Almighty, just and true are all your ways, you King of saints;
shall I not then fear before you and glorify your name?
O yes,--grant it may yet be permitted,
even if it is your will to try my faith and allegiance still further
in this land,--even if I must yet appear vile in my own eyes,
and the eyes of others: Lord, grant that your servant may take courage,
and set out again under this resolution, whenever you may be pleased to open the way;
and my soul craves that I may be able to leave my toil about my absent family,
and commend them to your Providential care and regard, whether in life or in death.
Grant this for your name and mercy sake, through my suffering Lord and Saviour; Amen.`"

On the 9th of eighth month, he addressed a letter to a Friend,
about entering on a religious visit, from which the following is extracted:

Ackworth school, 9th of Eighth month, 1799.

This morning, in my lonely, exercised state, you, my beloved friend,
came fresh into view, and your prospect, as contained in your last,
of setting off soon on another visit to the churches,
if approved by your monthly meeting, has frequently, since you wrote me,
exercised my mind with thoughtfulness and solicitude on your account.
I am sensible that it is a weighty and necessary
thing to experience a right putting forth;
and when out on visits of this kind, to know where, and what, and when,
to offer our gifts;
as well as to be favoured to steer a steady course
through all the ups and downs which are to be met with;
to bear with becoming patience those dispensations that
tend deeply to humble and abase the creature;
and also to view with an eye kept single,
some of the pleasing prospects that may at times await.
Many are pleased when the servants have a song,
and they can be delighted with and in some degree joy in it;
they see a beauty and comeliness, and gather near, and are ready to say, Well done.
And a few there are that can go, and are willing to set down by the waters of Babylon,
and sympathize with those whose harps are hung on the willows.
If you are set at liberty by your friends to proceed on this journey,
my soul craves ability to say, Go in this your might,
and the Lord accompany you by his goodness,
and preserve you on the right hand and on the left,
through all you may have to meet with,
and bring you back again to your father's house with peace in your bosom.

As to myself, here I am, left by all my friends,
and yet through favour my mind has been supported so far,
and borne up with a comfortable degree of cheerfulness;
perhaps my being so much among the dear children has helped:
we have experienced many tendering opportunities,
both when separate in their own apartments,
and also together in meetings.--came here from Leeds on third-day evening,
and requested a meeting next day, which was held, and after dinner, he,
with his companion took post chaise for Doncaster.
It was some comfort to my tried and shut up mind to hear say,
that I was in my place by staying at this institution;
feeling at the same time a little secret evidence also in myself,
has had a tendency to settle and balance me.

I see no opening to move: is not such a dispensation proving?
Who, just placed in my circumstance, for more than two years past,
to say nothing of what I passed through before, even a stronger bodied,
and stronger spirited man than myself,
but what would acknowledge his measure was nearly full?
But stop,--does not this border on murmuring and
repining at the dispensations of Providence?
Forbid it, O my soul! sink down to your Rock, your Creator, and crave ability to say.
Not my will, but yours, O God, be done.

I have lately written both Sarah Harrison and John Hall a farewell salutation,
but know not whether they have yet sailed.
And am thankful I feel so quiet and easy with respect to their leaving me.`"

"`Ninth month 4th.--Went to High Flats with James Buck and Jonathan Binns,
and on the 5th attended the select meeting, which was a poor time indeed.
To the monthly meeting, and sat the fore part through in distress and sorrow,
but when the meeting was emptied of strangers, I had a relieving time;
for my mind was exercised with a sense that love and unity were lacking:
considerable tenderness appeared.
After dinner met two old Friends who were at variance, accompanied by several others,
and got them so near again before we parted, as to take each other by the hand.

"`6th.--Rode to Sheffield, and on the 8th, first-day,
attended the morning and afternoon meetings, which were large,
and open times in testimony, to my admiration,
after having lately felt so poor and stripped.
Dear Thomas Colley is a beloved brother, and much in sympathy with me.
I ventured to appoint a meeting to be held tomorrow evening at six o'clock.

"`9th.--Cast down, but I hope not forsaken.
Lord, help through this one day more.
Attended a large meeting in the assembly room at six o'clock, where I had much labour;
it was quiet and solid, but I felt very poor after it.

"`10th.--O for strength and courage to hold fast a little longer, and say,
Your sovereign will be done in all things.

"`12th.--Awoke in deep thought, and prostrated myself in prayer.
The secret cry still is, 'How long, O Lord, how long?
and yet in the midst of all, and through all,
there is an invisible sustaining hope--thanks be to the God of my life,
or else I should have fainted before this time.
Went to the week-day meeting, and was comforted under the ministry of E. Hoyland,
and afterwards appeared in the same line.

"`15th,
first-day.--In the morning meeting had much
labour,--in the afternoon silent as to testimony.
It was very large.

"`19th.--To meeting, and had a laborious time among Friends.
In much weakness appointed a meeting to be held at six o'clock, for apprentice lads,
both Friends and others.
The house was filled up, and there were some in the adjoining room.
It proved a quiet time, and ended so,
considering how many raw boys of different descriptions were together;
and I felt relieved.
At the close I appointed one to be held tomorrow evening, for females only.

"`20th, sixth-day.--I feel easy and resigned, which is a mercy.
The evening meeting was pretty full, and although many, and perhaps most of them,
were raw, and very likely, much unacquainted with our manner, yet it proved a solid,
and I trust, edifying time.
I obtained much relief, and did not know but it might be the last meeting.
It so happened that there was a meeting appointed at the same time in the adjoining room,
called the card room, for some card players; and Friends appeared uneasy about it,
but I felt otherwise, and matters worked round pleasantly--they gave way,
and some of them stood at the door most of the time of our meeting,
and conducted themselves civilly.

"`22nd, first-day.--The meeting was large and a precious solid time,
for which I know I ought to be thankful.
After dinner went to Ackworth in a post chaise, and got a boy to ride my beast.
My dear friends are very kind, and I feel a grateful heart for such favours:
we got in before reading time,
and had a tendering season with the children and family collected,
and afterwards another opportunity with part of the family.

"`23rd.--Stiff and sore this morning, but easy and quiet in mind.
In the evening we had a sitting with the family and servants, which was a singular time,
and hope it will be to profit.
I went to the girls' reading, but could say but little and could not bid them farewell,
not knowing but I must come again; such has been my exercise this afternoon.

"`24th, third-day.--Arose early and packed up my things, and got to Lindley Murray's,
near York, and lodged.

"`25th.--To quarterly meeting, and had a very close time in the first meeting.
Dined at Henry Tuke's, and had a singular testimony in a sitting afterwards.
To the adjournment at five o'clock, which was a very trying sitting,
and a time of conflict to me.

"`26th.--To a parting meeting: I had nothing to communicate, and sunk very low after it.
I went to the girls' school and dined with William Tuke,
and felt a concern to go to the Retreat,
a place where about thirty of our Society are taken in, being disordered in mind.
We got most of them together, and after we had sat a little in quiet,
and I had vented a few tears, I was engaged in supplication.
Returned back to the school and drank tea, and after night to Lindley Murray's.

"`28th.--Got to my kind friends J. and G. Jowitt's, at Leeds,
where I met with my dear friends Joseph and Rachel Smith, very unexpectedly.

"`29th,
first-day.--Yesterday on the road my thoughts were
turned toward the little meeting at Wakefield,
about ten miles from this place, and it came up again this morning,
but with much weakness,
and on my bed I had doubts and fears lest I was wrong in turning about to this place.
This followed me on the road to Wakefield, to which I went;
fears and discouragements surrounded me as I sat among the little company,
so that I was almost overwhelmed,
and yet at the bottom of all there was a disposition to trust my God with my all;
and I ventured to stand up with a little encouragement to a small number.
We went to John Robinson's and dined: I still felt low and distressed,
and also very feeble in body.
Some time after dinner, a Friend who lives next door, an entire stranger, came in:
I noticed at different times, the tears running from her eyes,
and after a time in some little conversation,
she took courage and told me what sympathy she had felt with me, saying,
she had wished to see me at this place,
but being informed after York quarterly meeting
that there was little or no probability of it,
had pretty much given it out.
I was baptized into tears, and truly it was a time of mutual fellowship, I thought,
in the bonds of the gospel.
We were all much tendered, and I parted very sweetly from them, and derived encouragement.
We got back to Leeds and attended a meeting appointed at six o'clock,
in which I was greatly enlarged on these expressions; 'I have fought the good fight,
I have kept the faith,' etc.
I was astonished to find such a change:
thanks be to God for his unspeakable mercy in thus breaking my bonds for the present.
Phebe Blakes concluded the meeting in prayer, such a one as I have not often heard;
she prayed for me, and that the testimony of Truth might be blessed with success.
It was a sweet meeting throughout, and I spent the evening pleasantly after it,
in company with many Friends, and had a religious time with many youth.

"`30th, second-day.--Arose with a degree of courage and cheerfulness,
and after breakfast had a singularly open time of stirring up, with encouragement,
in the family of P. N.; also a tendering opportunity at Benjamin Jowitt's,
and one at our lodgings.
In the afternoon P. N. accompanied me to Christiana Hustler's,
where we had the company of several Friends.

We dropped into silence after supper, and my mind was covered with unusual weight,
and under it I kneeled down in supplication.

"`Tenth month 1st.--Went to Manchester and attended a
meeting of ministers and elders at five o'clock,
where I met with Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young, also M. Hoyland, from Ireland:
it was a low time to me, my exercise being great, but I endeavoured to bear up.

"`2nd fourth-day.--A very memorable day.
Martha Routh opened the meeting in prayer,
and afterwards I was favoured with an enlarged testimony.
Deborah Darby followed, and owned me as a brother and fellow labourer,
with sympathetic expressions; and the closing part fell on me, in supplication.
The two sittings of men Friends were solid and preciously uniting: in the last,
Susanna Horne came in, accompanied by Martha Routh, and requested a meeting,
which was appointed at six o'clock in the evening.
In this meeting I was soon brought on my knees in supplication: dear Susanna had an open,
good time, and several young ones also appeared.
A little fell to my lot near the close,
and Rebecca Young concluded the meeting in supplication, and we returned, I hope,
pretty universally rejoicing.

"`3rd.--Accompanied by John Taylor and Samuel Watkins, went to Stockport,
and had a large and satisfactory meeting at six o'clock, in a cotton room,
where I met with M. Hoyland, who closed the meeting in prayer: lodged at George Jones'.

"`4th.--After breakfast returned to Manchester and attended an appointed meeting,
at seven o'clock, in Friends' meeting-house, which was large and solid.

"`5th.--Dined at R. and H. Barnard's with Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young,
and afterwards had a solid sitting,
wherein dear Deborah was sweetly drawn forth in testimony.
I felt her sympathy, and ventured to conclude the opportunity in prayer.

"`6th, first-day.--To meeting at ten o'clock, which was pretty much filled up,
although a rainy time, and I felt considerable openness to the people.
The meeting at six o'clock was full, both houses being open,
and a very solid opportunity it was, and much to the relief of my mind.
John Thorp appeared in prayer, and John Taylor in testimony;
and both of these Friends came afterwards and spent the remainder of the evening with me.

"`7th.--Comfortable and easy this morning; feel relieved in good degree,
and desire to stand open to further presentations of religious duty.
A rainy day, and spent it mostly within doors: no opening to appoint another meeting,
and feel content, I humbly hope and trust, in the divine will.

"`8th.--Exercised in looking over the inhabitants of this town,
and went with Friends to look at several large buildings with a view to a meeting.

"`9th.--To a week-day meeting, and silent;
thought much of a public meeting to relieve my mind.
After tea felt an opening to give liberty to invite the people,
tomorrow evening at six o'clock, to Friends' meeting-house.

"`10th.--After breakfast walked to Daniel Holt's, a mile and a half out of town,
with John Thorp, and dined:
went to see his cotton works--he and partners employ six hundred persons.
The evening meeting was large, and though laborious, ended solidly;
many of the principal persons of the town came.

"`11th.--A conflicting time before I left my bed,
but upon endeavouring to resign all up to boundless mercy and goodness,
I felt easier and relieved with respect to the inhabitants of Manchester.
O what wadings I have to go through sometimes,
before I can appoint and get through but one meeting.
Set off about eleven o'clock with Isaac Hadwin, in his chaise,
and arrived at our friend John Wood's, at Bolton, about one o'clock,
there being a meeting appointed at six, to be held in a barn which was long in gathering,
but concluded solidly and satisfactorily.

"`12th.--After a tendering opportunity in John Wood's family,
with several who stepped in, Isaac Hadwin brought me to Liverpool, about thirty miles,
and arrived about five o'clock, and those dear friends, Robert and S. Benson,
received me once more under their hospitable roof, with much kindness.
After supper we dropped into silence, and in it my mind was sweetly calmed and refreshed,
and hope some of us were baptized by the one true baptism,
and enabled to drink into one spirit in a good degree.

"`A paragraph in the paper today, states that a letter has been received from Baltimore,
giving an account of the fever having broken out in Philadelphia;
and that in consequence, the public offices are all shut, and the city nearly deserted.
It is an alarming account, but I am not disposed fully to believe it.

"`13th, first-day.--To meeting, and was comfortably opened so as to relieve my mind.
Susanna Horne appeared in supplication for infidels, etc.
The afternoon meeting was put off until six o'clock, and was large and laborious,
yet pretty comfortably relieving.
When I got into Robert Benson's after the meeting,
an exercise which had impressed my mind since leaving Manchester quarterly meeting,
of going to Ulverstone, revived so pressingly, that I opened it to my friends.

"`14th.--Set off between ten and eleven o'clock,
accompanied by Robert Benson in his chaise, and lodged at Preston.

"`15th.--We arrived at David Dockray's, at Lancaster, before dinner,
and found there was no crossing the sands to Ulverstone this day.
In the afternoon took a walk with my companion and John Dockray to see the castle.
We saw the room where they say George Fox and others were confined.
Thanks for so quiet and resigned a mind;
and my soul craves ability to advance in the Christian race,
so as to be able to adopt the Apostle's advice; 'ln every thing give thanks.'
Surely there is occasion so to do, when I can only believe with tried Jacob;
'The Lord is in this place.'
The Lord has been near my soul when plunged in the deeps;
when wave followed wave,--when the weeds were wrapped about my head.
O for continued ability to say in sincerity, and in deep abasement and humility,
'Your will, O God, be done.'
Subject mine unto it--then let what will come, your name will be sanctified,
and my soul purified in the furnace of affliction.
Grant this, for your name and your mercy sake.

"`16th.--Was called up about half past four o'clock, and between five and six set off,
accompanied by George Barrow:
we crossed the sands and got to Ulverstone near an hour after meeting time;
it was much such a season as at this time two years ago.
Some time after I sat down, I went on my knees and prayed for poor mournful Zion,
that her gates, yes, her very dust, might be remembered,
and afterwards told Friends I had a prospect of a better day,
and held forth encouragement to old and young.
After meeting I went to the old house where Judge Fell lived;
and being told that the widow and children whom I visited when here before, had removed,
and that the man who took the place died about two months ago, and has left a widow;
I called to see her,
but she appeared very raw and very little of that tenderness so manifest in the other,
who to my comfort continues loving to Friends.
Attended a full meeting in an assembly room at six o'clock.

"`17th.--Set off in a post chaise, and had a very pleasant ride to Kendal,
and gave liberty to invite the neighbours together at six o'clock,
in which I was as open as I had any expectation of, although not large;
however my mind was relieved.

"`19th.--Reached Liverpool about four o'clock, after a pleasant ride,
and I feel satisfied that it was right to go this little tour.

"`20th, first-day.--Attended the morning meeting,
where my friend Susanna Horne had considerable labour in a close line,
and some also fell to my lot.
Appointed a meeting at six o'clock and requested
friends to give notice to the upper class of people,
slave importers, etc.; it was large,
and a number of the description I wanted to see attended,
and it was a relieving opportunity.

"`21st.--All seems closed up with respect to
Liverpool;--I desire ability to say in sincerity,
'Not my will, but yours be done, O Lord.'

"`22nd.--Awoke in sorrow of heart.
O that it were the Lord's will this mountain of exercise might be removed.
But if there is yet a measure, even of more bitter suffering to be filled up,
may my soul be favoured to say, your will be done.
Purge me from iniquity, and extend your mercy, O Lord, or I faint and fail by the way.

"`24th.--Awoke early, and trouble awoke with me.
I was as a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
Attended week-day meeting,
and on returning endeavoured to anoint my head and wash my face,
and ate what dinner I could; and afterwards my soul was exercised,
and venturing to call the family of my dear friends Robert and S. Benson together,
I poured it out in supplication for ourselves as travellers, for the parents, children,
and servants, and for the inhabitants of the town; and then set off,
accompanied by my friends Susanna Horne, Joseph Smith, and John Hadwin to Warrington.

"`25th.--Joseph Smith and James Foster accompanied us to Leek: we put up at T. Chorley's,
and although he is gone to London, we were kindly provided for:--a day of great exercise,
in which the cry of my soul has been, Lord, help through and over all,
that I may not be swallowed up.

"`26th.--Struggled along through this one day more--got into Derby before night,
and found several Friends there from Nottingham.`"

The following is extracted from a letter addressed to him by his friend Sarah Talbot,
from America, then on a religious visit to Friends in England;

Warrington, seventh-day morning, Tenth month, 1799.

My dear, friend, Thomas Scattergood,

I received your letter yesterday morning, and it was very gratifying to me,
but it would have been more so to have had an interview with you;
but pleasant things are not always best for me.
I feel much for you and do sympathise with you, believing you to be greatly tried;
but it is in my heart to say to you, 'be encouraged, and trust in God;
for He has been your helper,
and I verily believe will continue to help you through all and over all,
to your peace of mind and His own glory.'
Therefore, my dear friend, have patience and stay your appointed time for your release;
which I believe you wilt be favoured to see with clearness,
when your great and good Master shall say you have done enough; for I verily believe,
all things will work together for good, unto all those that love and serve God.
My hopes and fears have been more than they ought to have been,
about your going with me across the sea; but when I may go, I know not,
for I expect the Liverpool packet will sail before I am ready, if it goes in one week,
as we have eleven meetings yet to visit, which will take us nearly two weeks.
When they are visited, I have thought from the feeling of my mind,
that I might be at liberty to return home,
and no Friend's company in England would be as acceptable to me as yours.
If we had been informed that your stay at Warrington had been so short,
we should have met you there, but it is now over,
and I feel a hope that we shall meet when our
religious labour in this land is accomplished,
in the enjoyment of sweet peace of mind: yes, my dear friend,
I verily believe this will be your experience, if you abide in patience.`"

"`27th, first-day.--I said in my heart,
how is it possible to get through the meeting I have appointed?
To believe and trust, when hope is cut off;--'our hope is cut off,
we are like a dry withered branch.'
Language fails to set forth my state this morning,
and yet I went to the meeting appointed, and laboured largely.
This is a mystery indeed, and I thought myself a very unworthy creature.
In the evening we had the little company of Friends in this place together,
in an upper chamber at the Bell inn.
It was a singular time, and my companion was opened with much clearness;
some labour fell to my lot; and now, after supper,
I feel much lightened from the burden and oppression I have waded under for days.
'Hope deferred makes the heart sick.'
How thankful I feel for this little ease:--Lord, my God, your will be done.
You have an undoubted right to do with your creatures as you please.
Take not your Holy Spirit from me; take not your loving kindness from me.`"

In a letter dated eleventh month 4th, to his son, he says;

"`There are several in Derby who have applied to be taken into membership,
there being a little company who have met in the way of Friends for some time past.
When I was there two years ago, I visited them in their families,
and one of the oldest now tells me,
that the number who meet has increased in these two years to double.
It has been a comfort to my often depressed and exercised mind, to find here and there,
by going over the ground again, some fruits--some convincements: the Lord be praised,
whose work it is.`"

After some remarks respecting returning to America with Sarah Talbot he says;

"`I had set my mind on going with her as much as was profitable, and how it may be yet,
is uncertain.
Let us all endeavour to dwell in faith and patience.
I have been marvellously tried about home, the sickness at Philadelphia, etc.,
and when favoured to resign all up, there has been a comfortable portion of peace.
I desire to stand in my allotment,
even though it has been in the watch-tower in the day time,
and as it were in the ward whole nights.
The Lord restrain the murmurer and repiner,
and mercifully keep me on the bottom and ground of truth, in and through all;
that neither winds, nor rains, nor floods may overturn my foundation.
I think I can say with uprightness, it is my desire to get home in the Lord's time,
not my own; whose servant my soul desires yet to remain.`"

"`28th.--Took an affectionate farewell of the landlord,
whose heart is much opened towards me, and arrived at Litchfield about three o'clock,
and my friends who accompanied me, with Richard Leaver,
were industrious in getting a place to meet and inviting the people.
This meeting was held in the town-hall, and a great concourse of people there was,
and much was on my mind to express,
although in a weak state and still under great exercise of mind.

"`29th, third-day.--Moved on to Birmingham and had an evening meeting;
many of the people attended, and here again I had much labour.

"`30th.--This morning set off early by coach for Chippingnorton, and after breakfast,
accompanied by George Boon, I went to Worcester and had an evening meeting;
it was laborious, and I felt unworthy to move in this line.

"`31st.--Accompanied by Richard Burlingham and nephew,
went near forty miles to Chippingnorton, a meeting being appointed there;
felt very low and poor indeed, and was content in silence,
my friend having most of the labour.

"`Eleventh month 1st.--My beloved friend William Hull having met me last evening,
I rode with him to Oxford.
How shall I describe my feelings of late;--I am now at an inn in this place,
a lonely poor pilgrim.
One more meeting appointed at Jordans, and my feelings, I think,
resemble those of the poor woman, who was gathering a few sticks to bake her last cake,
and then lie down and die, as she thought.
How did Ezekiel feel when he baked the cakes and ate them?
and when he lay so many days on his side, bearing the sin of Israel?
O why am I a man of such sorrow?
Is it all a fruitless thing?
Lord, God, almighty and powerful, who can resist your will?
Look down in mercy upon me, a poor stripped creature, and help me through all,
and over all; for I faint and fail without you.

"`2nd.--Went to Adey Bellamy's, at High Wiccomb, and was kindly cared for,
and I felt more ease of mind: many friends called in the evening and sat with us,
among whom I had some religious communication.

"`3rd, first-day.--Had a pretty full meeting at Jordans,
but almost all was sealed up as to myself.
My friend Susanna Horne had considerable to communicate,
and appeared also in supplication.
I advised the people at the close of the meeting, to inquire for,
and read the writings of Isaac Penington, William Penn, and Thomas Ellwood,
who very probably had often sat in this house, which is now mostly deserted and shut up.
I told them, likewise, of instances where meeting houses had been closed for a time,
and that by the religious concern of one individual only,
who felt it a duty to go and set alone to worship the Almighty,
the meeting had been revived and numbers added.
Most of the people appeared very raw; my own conflict was great,
and my situation trying indeed.
After the meeting we proceeded to Uxbridge,
and put up at Samuel Hull's. Parted from my beloved sister, Susanna Horne:
she proposes going to London with S. Hull,
having her mind charged with a prospect of a family visit to Grace-church street meeting;
may the Almighty go with and help her through this and all others,
and give her a reward when the race of life is run, is the craving of my soul.

"`4th, second-day.--After resigning myself quietly to stop here,
I lay down pretty comfortably: awoke, and lay about two hours in deep thoughtfulness,
and yet accompanied with more than usual settlement and quiet.
I took a retrospect of my journeying and prospects of later months,
having now got through what opened sometime back, concerning Manchester, Liverpool,
Derby, Litchfield, Worcester, Chippingnorton, and Jordans;
and though my soul has been let down very low, I thought,
how could I have done otherwise in my journeyings.
Deep were the searchings of heart, in looking over my steppings,
and I besought the Lord for a covering of mercy and love;
and that I might be favoured to experience more settlement and peace.
My wife and home, etc., came up, and my soul craved ability to offer up all,
and that my feeble desires might meet with acceptance before the throne.
Is there a baptism for me to be baptised with in this land, in London?
Is there a cup to drink of; and am I yet to remain a prisoner in bonds?
Lord, only grant me remission, wash away all guilt and stain,
and receive me graciously into favour,--point out the way and go before,
and behold your servant, your tribulated servant,
be it unto him according to your will and your word,
in further steppings along in this land,
and grant that I may clearly see the time to leave it, and that it may be in peace,
after so many years of deep conflict.
All this you can accomplish--do it in your own way and time,
and humble my soul into submission to your sovereign will.
I thank you.
Lord and Master, for support in the deepest trials; yet with blushing and confusion,
when I view my strugglings and lack of fully exercising faith.
O extend your free mercy:--O Lord, protect and preserve my children;
let them be yours in life and in death.
It has been a day of some ease, from that oppression and death often felt.
I endeavoured to anoint my head and wash my face.

"`6th.--Attended week-day meeting,
and was favoured with a comfortable degree of calm upon looking over my accounts;
but much humbled.
Stood up in the latter part of the meeting and had some religious communication,
which appeared to have a tendering, humbling effect,
and I felt quiet and calm after it.`"

The following is an extract of a letter, addressed to his beloved friend Susanna Horne,
dated:

Uxbridge, eleventh month 6th, 1799.

My dear friend,

I know it is an arduous work to visit families, yet believe it to be a blessed one,
and it has proved so to some.
Take up then your penny received, after getting through the meeting; it is lawful,
and sometimes expedient so to do, and view it carefully, and observe the image;
a small piece with the King's stamp, is sufficient.
May your Divine master grant you a larger portion, if it be his will,
when you have performed this present engagement.
Be faithful in the work, remembering it is not a concern of yesterday;
fear not with man's fear, least you be confounded.
Your soul has been humbled of late--may such dispensations fit you for the Lord's work;
you must expect it will be so.
These humble ones are taught in the way often times, though it is a trying one,
and the meek are led in the paths of judgment.
I have been a tried man since we parted, and you know much so since we left Liverpool;
and through mercy I hope my all is given up.
I told you no way opened further than this place, and so it remains.
It seemed like coming up to a wall, without a gate way through.
O may my poor oppressed soul yet trust in God,
and wait patiently upon him all the days of my appointed time, until a change come.
My love to your dear father, and tell him I have a hope I shall yet see him,
and be with him to our mutual comfort and consolation; the Lord grant it may be so,
and that we may obtain a mansion of rest together,
when done with the fading enjoyments of this world; this is not the thought of a moment,
but at times, when further absent.

Your affectionate friend,

Thomas Scattergood.

"`7th.--To High Wiccomb monthly meeting, accompanied by Samuel Hull in his chaise.
I went in a humbled state, and sat along side of my dear brother George Dillwyn.
My soul craved a seal of some encouragement,--and was favoured with a view,
that the great and good Master would bring to pass his purposes,
which at times had opened on my mind, in which I felt calm and content;
and after dear George got through his exercise in the ministry,
I kneeled down in supplication, and felt calm and easy through the business.
After dinner a number of friends came in, and my mind was stirred up to speak,
and tenderness and brokenness appeared.
I had to address M. E., who is in a very low state,
and now lives separate from her husband and children.
Rode to Amersham and put up at R. E.'s.

"`8th.--Dined at E. Raper's with George Dillwyn and wife and others,
after which we were favoured with a comfortable uniting opportunity together.
Soon after this returned to Uxbridge.`"

He remained in Uxbridge until the 21st of the twelfth month,
and at times in a very exercised state of mind,
in consequence of having no clear opening to move in any religious service.
Several prospects presented during this period, but were either soon removed,
or did not continue with sufficient weight and clearness,
to induce him to believe it would be right to pursue them.
In this tried state, his prevailing desire appears to have been,
to be favoured with patience and resignation to the Lord's will,
and to be preserved from doing or moving, except under Divine guidance.
He appears, however, to have been impressed with a belief,
that he should be obliged to go again to London,--which with the remembrance
of the trials and deep baptisms he had passed through in that city,
about a year previously, no doubt had a tendency at times to depress his spirits.
Notwithstanding this prospect was extremely trying,
he was earnestly desirous of performing faithfully the whole
service which his Divine master required of him in that land,
which led him often to pray for Divine direction,
though frequently silent in the meetings, which he regularly attended in this place;
yet he appears to have been, at times, very considerably enlarged in them,
as well as in private opportunities; many of which he describes as solid,
tendering While here, he received the following letter,
giving an account of the departure of Sarah Talbot for her native land;

Sarah Talbot to Thomas Scattergood

Liverpool, eleventh month 10th, 1799.

My dear friend, Thomas Scattergood,

Your acceptable letter I received since I came here,
where I am waiting for the wind to change,
it being contrary to leave this port for America;
for which I now think I feel at liberty to embark in the Liverpool packet,
bound for New York, which it was said was ready to sail when we got here,
and the Captain said he would sail yesterday a week ago;
but when we came to Robert Benson's, found to the contrary,
and have been endeavouring to get ready.
I believe I shall be at liberty, for anything that I now see,
to leave this land with peace of mind;
though I do surely know that I am a poor unworthy servant,
if worthy to be called a servant, and have not anything to boast of, no verily;
yet may say to you, my beloved friend and brother,
that the peace and quietude of mind I have felt since I came here,
have bowed my heart in thankfulness before Him who has been with me,
and helped me to do the work appointed: and I verily believe He will be with you,
and enable you to do his will: your work is great in this land,
and if it should be lengthened out some time longer,
may you be favoured with patience to hold out to the end,
for it is the end which crowns all.
If it had been the will of Him who knows all hearts,
and undoubtedly orders all things right,
that you and I should have gone together over the waters,
it would have been very desirable to me to have had so dear a brother on the seas;
but how different is it likely to be: no friend or acquaintance going, and but one woman,
and she as a steerage passenger;
so you may see that I am likely to have a lonely time of it,
but I feel resigned and not much discouraged,
and hope that He who cares for the sparrows, will care for me.

Her companion, Sarah Shackleton, adds:

"`Although I feel myself in a very bereaved state,
and as much as I can do to keep up a suitable appearance,
having lost a precious companion, whom I have experienced to be a nursing mother,
who preached continually to me in the expressive language of example;
yet I am unwilling to detain her letter, or the news of her being on shipboard.
Orders were received to come on board, for the ship was on her way,
while we were sitting quietly at our work yesterday morning.
It was thought best for no friend but Robert Benson (who was the only
man friend there) to go with her in a boat to the ship:
we saw her safely on board, and the vessel sail beautifully down the river,
on a very smooth sea, but had not been long returned to Robert Benson's,
before an awful storm came on, which continued several hours.
I should have been thankful either to have had her here, or to have been with her there;
we suppose the ship has cast anchor at the Rock, about three miles from this place.
Perhaps I may have more certain intelligence before I need seal this.
The sky begins to look again as it did yesterday evening,
and I expect another storm is coming: how distressing to have her lying so near us,
and she without an intimate friend to speak to.
She reminded me yesterday of an obedient dependent child,
throwing itself into the arms of its father,
trusting that he would protect from all danger.

Sixth-day, 15th.--After some trying days,
we have received the agreeable news of the Liverpool packet
having really sailed away with a pretty fair wind.
I had a letter from dear Sarah yesterday, which says,
'Before dinner was done (the 12th) the storm began; I was in my chair,
and between the table and a chest; the table was lashed, or I could not have sat:
the things began to tumble about from side to side as the storm increased,
so that the carpenter was ordered to be at hand with his axe, in case of extremity,
to cut away the mast, that the vessel might drive before the wind.
But He who cares for the sparrows, caused the wind to shift,
and then they made towards land.
On inquiry I was informed, that we were going for Liverpool, of which I was glad.
I did not think that we should perish,
but it was a very alarming time until about midnight, when we got in here.
I am not much discouraged about my companions, although we have card players on board.
Five or six vessels have been much injured, and one wrecked;
what cause have we to be thankful in being thus wonderfully preserved from harm,
only some of our rigging taken away.

Sarah Shackleton

"`20th.--The way to London felt open and clear this evening,
and I rejoiced to feel and see it so, and said in my heart, 'Lord, if you go not with me,
take me not up from here;' preserve me in my place.

"`21st.--This has been an open day pretty much throughout.
Left Uxbridge, accompanied by Samuel Hull, and got into Joseph Smith's, London,
soon after four o'clock: felt cheerful and well on setting out, and most of the way;
but when I entered London, began to sink, and spent the evening with Susanna Horne,
Sarah Lynes and others, low and exercised.

"`22nd, first-day.--A night of exercise to what I have experienced of late;
but through all, endeavoured to cast my care on the Lord, the only sure helper,
and experienced a comfortable support.
To morning meeting at Grace-church street, under close exercise;
and stood up once more with a searching testimony in the beginning,
but toward the close I hope the oil of divine consolation ran
from the Fountain into some drooping hearts,
as well as my own.
I remembered and expressed John Woolman's prospect, 'that the time was coming,
when he that was wisest in earthly policy would become
the greatest fool;' and also a prospect of a searching,
trying day approaching.
The afternoon meeting was a precious one to me, and hope also to others;
it was a time of encouragement.
I lay down sweet and easy after this day's work, being much relieved thereby.

"`23rd.--A comfortable night, and though when I awoke this morning,
a degree of trembling seized on me, yet it was mixed with that holy fear,
that broke and tendered my heart, in a sense of the preservations I have met with.
Attended the select quarterly meeting, and laboured therein to satisfaction;
and after it broke up, many Friends expressed their pleasure in seeing me once more,
which was encouraging to me.

"`24th.--My mind was enlarged in the quarterly meeting,
in which there were several new appearances.
The business was comfortably conducted,
and in the close I had another satisfactory time with the youth present.
Many Friends dined with us, with whom I had an opportunity to some relief.

"`25th.--After dinner my own situation came humblingly over me.
O Lord, bear me up in patient resignation, to do and to suffer your will.
Preserve me from the fear of the enemy.
My home is closed up and hid from me, and a humbling weight yet rests on my soul,
with respect to the inhabitants of this great city, and no opening to get clear of it.
May I with humility say, Why is my pain perpetual,
and my wound ceased to be healed'.' Why go I mourning all the day,
as with a sword piercing my soul,
and in the night season often times such trembling of heart?
You, the Almighty one, know, and my soul craves patience to endure until you remove it.

"`29th, first-day.--I attended Devonshire house meeting,
and after sitting nearly two hours, felt some openness to stand up,
endeavouring to encourage some seeking, sorrowful souls,
and felt an opening to appoint a public meeting at six o'clock.
Went to Grace-church street meeting in the afternoon,
and had to speak encouragingly to some seekers present.
In the large assembly convened at six o'clock, I laboured some time, but felt a stop,
and told the meeting so, believing it not right to exceed the gift and feeling;
and after a time Sarah Lynes stood up and was much enlarged.

"`31st.--O Lord, have mercy on me and save me,
seems to be the prevalent cry of my poor travailing soul.

1800, first month, 2nd.--When I reflect how little I am engaged in actual service,
it appeal's sometimes as if I was an idler away of time; but then again,
are not the conflicts I have endured for years to be esteemed labour?
It seems like the war we read of between Michael and his angels,
against the Devil and his.
O that he was cast out, and if consistent with the divine will,
my soul was set at liberty.
When in meeting there is an opening to speak, I fear to forbear, and it is a mercy,
that in this respect no disobedience comes up against me.
Rather let my life go, than that I should reproach the Truth, or dishonour God,
I went to Tottenham meeting, and was favoured with sweetness and calmness of mind,
wherein my faith was renewed in the all-sufficient power and mercy of God,
to carry me through my conflicts in this land,
and to enable me to fulfil all his requirings.
When faith is raised, which is only the gift of God, how it renews that hope,
which is an anchor to the soul.
I was thankful, and had to speak encouragingly to others; for which the Lord be praised,
and let him be waited on in all trials, and in all desertions.

"`4th.--A secret hope spreads on my mind, that the time is drawing near,
when there will be an opening towards home;
and if it is the Lord's will that I must leave this land without a full discharge,
and even if my foolishness appear to myself and others, your sovereign will be done.
I crave ability to trust in you, and lie prostrate at your feet.
You, and you only can change my wilderness into a more fruitful field.
How pleasant the thought of being favoured to move towards America in peace: yes,
it is pleasant to feel a disposition and willingness to trust in God,--to cast body,
soul and spirit on his goodness and power.
What are words, what are memorandums?
As respects the latter, perhaps I may have to look over them in a day to come,
and be humbled, as I feel at this present moment.
O Lord, enable me to bind your dispensations,
proving and trying to uneasy flesh as they are, as jewels and chains about my neck.
O that I might be favoured to declare in the congregations of the people,
that you are good when you give, and also when you take away.
My soul desires to say, Blessed be your name, even with tears and a broken heart,
for you are the healer of the broken in heart, and the binder up of their wounds.

"`5th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting,
where Sarah Lynes had a very enlarged time.
I sat content under it; her companion also appeared in testimony and supplication.
After dinner I felt so oppressed that I went up to my chamber,
and prostrated myself in awfulness and trembling before the Lord;
afterwards went to meeting, where P. Chester and Susanna Horne appeared in testimony,
and in the close, remembering the Apostle's advice, 'He that is afflicted,
let him pray,' I ventured to bend once more in supplication.

"`9th, fifth-day,--To Ratcliff meeting; sat long in silent travail and conflict,
and towards the close had to speak of the trials to be met with, etc,;
my faith was revived, and I felt pretty cheerful and comfortable afterward.

"`12th.--Recruited in health this morning and my mind more at ease,
for which favour I feel thankful, I hope humbly so.
Went to Grace-church street meeting,
and am ready to think it was the very closest time I ever had in this place:
I believe some opposed and fought against the communication, but I felt easy.
Went again in the afternoon, and both on the way there, and in the meeting,
my mind felt easy.
It was a time of encouragement, there being a class present,
different from some in the morning: drank tea at William Phillips',
and after it had a comfortable sitting.

"`13th, second-day.--Attended the morning meeting, and felt very poor;
yet in a comfortable degree quiet.
Sarah Lynes and Susanna Horne completed their visits, and I came to Tottenham with them.

"`14th, third-day.--Is it not good to dwell in a broken state, and be able to say,
Your will be done; and when called on, to be found like the spouse in the Canticles,
who says; 'I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on; I have washed my feet,
how shall I defile them?
I hope and desire to be right, and to be in my place,
even though it may be that afflictions abide me wherever I go.

"`16th, fifth-day.--Had a few words to offer in meeting from these expressions;
'My soul is athirst for God.'
Susanna Horne closed the meeting in supplication.

"`19th, first-day.--Sat the meeting through in silence.
Susanna Horne appeared with an encouraging testimony.
In the afternoon meeting the cloud was lifted up,
and I felt an openness and some enlargement of heart, and stood up in this sense,
with a language of encouragement to the widows, the desolate,
and the fatherless children, and spent a pleasant evening afterwards.

"`21st, third-day--A night of exercise, both in sleep and when awake:
I strove to to be resigned and bear my burden with patience,
and hope I was favoured to say, in the secret of my heart, on leaving my bed, 'Your will,
O Lord, be done;' grant me patience to wait on you,
and that I may not bring reproach on the blessed Truth I came to promote.
Arose measurably resigned to suffer in silence.
After breakfast took up the Bible,
and on opening it my eye fixed on the seventh verse of the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah;
'For the Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.'

"`23rd.--Much exercised this morning, and a sweetness attended;
went to meeting and had an open time in testimony.

"`Second month 2nd,
first-day.--It is truly cause of thankfulness that my
mind was favoured with so much calm last evening.
O Lord, my desire in the deeps has been unto you, and the remembrance of your holiness;
and the cry of my soul has been, 'Be my physician,
and heal me,' I crave ability to resign up all, both body and soul,
to your providential care.
If you had not cared for me I surely should have fainted and failed: time is yours,
and though it appears to be a long time I have spent in this land,
and mostly in silent sorrow and suffering; yet, if you please to accept my offerings,
even in sorrow of soul, let your will be done.
I attended Tottenham meeting, and was much enlarged;
and after dinner attended the burial of the eldest son of Dr. Letsom,
where I was again opened amongst a numerous company of Friends and others, who attended,
and returned to Whitehart Lane, after drinking tea at William Forster's,
and having an opportunity, and was particularly led to visit a little son of J. H.,
who was much broken:
had also a religious time in the family of my dear friend Thomas Horne;
and it is marvellous it should be thus, after the distress I have felt.

"`4th, third-day.--Sweetness of mind on awaking:
my soul bows in thankfulness for this portion of ease.
Worship with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

"`7th.--O that this mountain was dissolved by the Lord's power,
and that more continued ease and freedom of spirit was granted:
this has been often my desire.
But stop, my tried soul, and be willing yet to suffer.
It is not suffering when we fully see and feel what we suffer for;
but when we have to live by faith alone, and by hope alone,
that that there will be a change.
O then, not my will, but yours be done, O God: all power and strength is yours.

"`8th.--Am I filling up my measure in thus moving and acting from day to day?
If I am not in suffering and pain for the inhabitants of this island,
then deceit has entered.
Lord, keep me patiently resigned to your will, in suffering; for little else can I see.

"`9th, first-day.--In the morning meeting I was silent,
and in the afternoon was opened to the youth, in a manner beyond my expectation.
Drank tea at William Forster's, and here again, with a large company,
I had a satisfactory opportunity.

"`10th.--To London, and attended morning meeting,
where I found Thomas Colley on a religious visit to this city and neighbourhood.

"`11th.--To Devonshire house meeting, and had an open time.
Mary Sterry closed the meeting in prayer.

"`12th.--Accompanied Thomas Colley to Peel meeting;
he spoke to a tried state from these expressious:
'There is a life that can live in the midst of death.'
I felt a little toward the close, to offer in the same line.

"`13th.--To Westminster monthly meeting with Thomas Colley and R. L.: I was silent.
Thomas Colley began with these expressions; 'They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.'

"`20th.--O London! what I have passed through in you!
Where will your haughty sons and daughters appear when
the Almighty and just One visits and humbles you?
My desire is to your name, and to the remembrance of you, O Lord, in the deeps.
I went with Joseph and Rachel Smith to Westminster meeting, and felt an opening to speak,
and relief was administered.
T+++.+++ C. and R. H. were married; I dined with the wedding company,
and in the evening had an opportunity with them.
The cloud of distress was removed for a season,
and I worshipped in prostration under this sense.

"`21st.--Quiet and resigned, I wait daily to feel my way rightly,
and it is a mercy I am not overwhelmed.
In company with my friend Joseph Smith, I went on board the ship Kensington,
bound for Philadelphia, with a view of feeling how it may be respecting going home.
After sitting alone, and weighing and considering things,
there appears no opening to make a move homewards,
although I have been six years from wife and family and friends.
It seems as though there was yet something to accomplish, and whether it be in doing,
or whether in filling up the measure of suffering;
whether more of the roll is to be eaten, or more of the little book is to be digested,
in order to prophesy, I know not.
O for patience when nothing is to be seen,
and that I may yet be preserved to walk by faith, and know purification thereby.
All things are yours, you Saviour of men, and you give as you please of your blessings;
enable me to bless your name when you withdraws or withholds.

"`23rd.--Attended Peel meeting in the morning, and had a pretty relieving time:
was at Grace-church street in the afternoon, and a very large meeting for the youth,
in the evening, wherein I had a share of labour with Thomas Colley,
W+++.+++ C. and Sarah Lynes.

"`25th.--Was favoured with an opening, tendering time at Devonshire house.

"`28th.--To Clerkenwell children's meeting, and an open opportunity.
My heart is thankful to feel a little change of dispensation:
may I be favoured not to abuse the liberty.

"`Good when thou gives, supremely good, Nor less when thou denies;
Crosses and exercises in your sovereign hand Are blessings in disguise.`"

"`Third month 2nd.--Attended Devonshire house in the morning,
and Grace-church street in the afternoon; also the burial of a clerk, who died suddenly;
and in the evening at six o'clock, went to a meeting in the new house at the Park;
in all which I was exercised to my own peace and comfort.

"`3rd.--I find no discharge from this warfare; but if I am an enlisted soldier,
I shall be cared and provided for.
Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.
I went with Ann Christy to Wandsworth, with Thomas Colley in company, and had a low,
silent time; there were only three men Friends at meeting.
To an evening meeting at six o'clock, which was pretty full,
and Thomas Colley laboured amongst them.
Stopped at C. West's school, where I felt an exercise,
and was favoured to relieve my mind; the widow of a late lord mayor was present,
and much affected.

"`6th.--Attended monthly meeting at Croydon, where a little labour fell to my lot.
It was close to some, but hope the oil of consolation was administered to a few,
and felt by them.
O poor county of Sussex! how mammon and the wisdom of this world have
spoiled your sons and daughters making profession with us.

"`7th.--Went to Kingston, accompanied by Thomas Colley and John Townsend,
and put up at the widow Rachel Owens', opposite the meeting-house:
we sat with three women and one man, beside three Friends from Esher.
It was a meeting of trouble to me; I sat and thought of George Fox and others,
who used to meet here, and mourned over the state of our Society;
yet felt but little or no strength to say anything.
Thomas Colley was silent, but I told them some of my thoughts.
I trust the time will come when the command, the sweet command, will be heard; 'Arise,
Zion and shine, for your light is come.
Arise, and put on your beautiful garments.'
But there must he a shaking of the dry bones first: the Lord hasten the day,
for my soul longed, as I sat in this meeting, to behold it with my eyes.
To a meeting at six o'clock, which was pretty large,
and dear Thomas Colley had a full time, which appeared satisfactory:
silent burden bearing was my portion.
To Esher and lodged.

"`9th, first-day.--To Wandsworth meeting, where was a company of gay, flashy people.
I felt discouraged at first; but after a time was enabled pretty fully to relieve my mind.
Various Friends came to see me in the evening, with whom I had a tendering time.

"`15th.--Felt a little opening towards Hartford quarterly meeting;
and Mary Sterry took me in a post chaise; we got to our friends,
John and Mary Pryor's after night, and I was unwell with a cold.

"`16th, first-day.--I was much opened and enlarged in both meetings today,
and felt some freedom in the quarterly select meeting also, which began at six o'clock.

"`17th.--Went to quarterly meeting, and to my admiration had an open time,
though in much weakness of body.
I had to revive the memory of John Crook.
Left the meeting before it was over, and came home oppressed with a cold.
O Lord, I am yet oppressed in soul; deliver me, I pray you;
keep me in patient resignation to your will, and preserve from deceit.
How my faith is tried--how hard I find it to believe.
After an opportunity with a number of young Friends,
feel a little lightened and relieved;
but there is yet a cloud to pass through and be baptized in.

"`18th.--Staid in all day, poorly, but pretty easy and comfortable,
for which thankfulness covers my mind.

"`19th.--Mary Scott took Mary Pryor and me to Ware week-day meeting;
several came from Hartford,
and several after the interment of a corpse in the grave yard.
Mary Pryor had a close, yet sweet time, and I felt some openness also,
though it was with difficulty I could speak to be heard.

"`20th.--After breakfast, as dear Mary Pryor and I were sitting alone together,
she began in the line of religious communication, and said,
I had been much the companion of her thoughts in the night; not in sleep,
but in wakeful moments.
Expressed the sympathy she had felt for me in my
sufferings for the inhabitants of this land,
and that she believed the time was near when I should be set at liberty to go home,
and meet a kind reception,
and be made instrumental in watering the seed in
my own land--there being a work to be done:
she said she had prayed for me, that my voyage might be safe and prosperous,
and be made a blessing to the poor sailors;
that my prospects and labours would not be lost in this land,
for I had been made instrumental in speaking of a day of trial coming,
because of wickedness; and that it was her firm belief,
the Lord would carry me through and over all, to the end, and crown it with peace.
Lord, help my travailing soul to believe, not only in you, but your prophets;
and fulfil your purposes concerning your servant.
Here am I, prepare for what you have yet for me to do, and let your will be done.
Amen.

"`21st.--Spent this morning mostly in reading; dined at Mary Scott's,
the widow of Samuel Scott, who died about seven years ago.
She brought some of his memorandums in manuscript, which afforded me instruction.
They say of him, that he was a lively minister;
but I find he had a low opinion of himself.
A man weak in body, and often depressed in mind: his widow is about sixty-eight,
and appears to enjoy a comfortable share of health and spirits.
O this changeable world! how many ups and downs in it:
how uncertain are the best of blessings--that of husband and wife;
and what a mercy to be favoured at last, when troubles are at an end,
to join the company of those who are fixed, where there is neither marrying,
nor giving in marriage, but who are as the angels in heaven,
peacefully under the dominion and care of the everlasting Shepherd,
who laid down his life for us all.
Lord, grant that this may be my happy portion,
and those you have blessed me with in this life.

"`23rd.--I have spent one more week of my life in a poorly, broken down state of body;
but it has not been the most unpleasant.
O that this day I may be favoured so to wait upon the Lord,
as to know my strength renewed;
that I may experience more of an establishment in faith and patience,
and keep fast hold on hope, the anchor of the tried and tossed soul.
Attended both meetings: was silent in the morning,
but towards the close of the afternoon meeting a little arose on my mind to express.

"`24th.--After dinner dear Mary Pryor again broke forth
with a language of encouragement to me,
believing the Lord would not leave me, but bless in basket and store;
to all which I felt disposed to say, Amen.
Left Hartford after two o'clock, and arrived at Joseph Smith's, London, after tea,
where I found Thomas Colley.

"`25th.--To quarterly meeting,
and after Thomas Colley had pretty fully relieved his mind,
I stood up with an encouraging testimony to the youth, to some satisfaction.
To the adjournment at five o'clock, and had communication on various matters,
and felt satisfied.

"`27th, fifth-day.--Went with Thomas Colley to Tottenham,
and expected he would have had a public meeting, but the prospect died away with him.
Some light, and hope, and peace, sprang up near the close of this little week-day meeting.

"`29th.--Seeing no opening for present service in London,
and having a freedom to accept the kind offer of my friend John Hull,
I left the city in a post chaise, and arrived at Uxbridge to tea.

"`30th, first-day.--To meeting in a weeping state, and remained so most of the time,
and then went on my knees and begged that the Lord would be pleased to open my eyes.
O, if such a poor, humbled, reduced creature may ask, would it not be,
that I may not return to London again, unless there is a work to be done; and if so,
to be favoured to see it with clearness, and have strength to perform it; nevertheless,
not my will, but yours be done.
To afternoon meeting and was silent.

"`31st.--My friend John Hull took me to High Wiccomb, and lodged at Adey Bellamy's,
whose kindness appeared as great as ever.

"`Fourth month 1st.--Before meeting George Dillwyn came from a visit to Norfolk.
Went to meeting, where tears were my food for a considerable time;
dear George appeared in testimony, and my heart was broken,
under which I was engaged in supplication; and just as the meeting was closing,
I stood up with a few words, and was enlarged; much brokenness appeared,
as also again in the men's meeting for business;
and I admired much at the tears which dropped like rain from eyes present.
O Lord, preserve me, and go with me, according to your good hand upon me;
remove my iniquity, and bear with my infirmities;
make me more and more what I ought to be in your sight.

"`2nd.--To meeting, and I passed it in silence: dear George Dillwyn,
E+++.+++ Raper and C. Whiting had the service.

"`3rd.--The monthly meeting was to me a humbling time;
dear Adey Bellamy stood forth in a feeling, lively manner,
and spoke to such as were under trial, and after him George Dillwyn appeared,
and towards the close I knelt in supplication, and felt some relief;
the business was conducted comfortably.
After tea, J. H., E. Raper and I, went into a sick Friend's chamber,
and had a religious opportunity with her, which proved a tendering one.
The circumstance of Jesus visiting Martha, Mary and Lazarus, was mentioned;
and in the close our sick sister took me by the hand and said,
she believed I was a deeply exercised servant of the Most High,
and that there was in store for me, a hundred fold in this life,
and in the world to come, life everlasting,--and I said, The Lord grant it may be so;
being willing to believe that out of the mouth of two
or three witnesses the truth is established.
Spent the evening pleasantly in company with my beloved brother, George Dillwyn, wife, etc.

"`4th.--Returned to Uxbridge, and attended an evening meeting appointed for Thomas Colley.
This has been a comfortable day of rest in mind.

"`6th, first-day.--Went to a meeting at Jordans, and sat by Thomas Colley,
who was large in testimony.
Adey Bellamy also, appeared early in the meeting, but silence was my portion.
Returned to tea at D. Moline's, and attended a meeting at five o'clock,
where there seemed some little revival of faith in my own particular,
and I stood up and encouraged others, and spent the evening pleasantly.

"`15th.--My heart expands with gratitude and thankfulness in
being favoured to arise from my bed with so much ease,
and also for the opening last evening.
If there is then more for me to do in a different manner, than I ever yet experienced,
and these deep wadings and baptisms are to prepare me for it,
so help me everlasting Father.

"`16th.--Attended monthly meeting, and was opened in testimony to a degree of comfort,
and felt my mind turned towards Kent quarterly meeting.
This has been a day of the lifting up the cloud, and I lay down comfortably.

"`17th.--An intimation was given me on awaking, of receiving tidings from home;
and I thought if it was another messenger of death,
whether I should be warranted in going the little journey in prospect; it disappeared,
and I endeavoured to arise with a resolution to hold up my head.
When I came down stairs I found a letter from my son, inclosed in one from Joseph Smith,
giving an account of the quiet departure of my dear aged mother;
she died on the 22nd of the second month.
I have frequently thought since I parted from her, as well as at the time,
that I should be favoured to see her close, and receive her blessing,
and now am a little straitened about it; but perhaps it was wisely so ordered.
The Lord's will be done, for there has been a sweetness accompanying my mind,
in a hope that it is well with her soul; yes, at seasons,
under deep conflict and prayer on my own account, and on hers,
there has been an answer of peace.`"

On the 16th he thus writes to a dear friend in the ministry:

Uxbridge, fourth month 16th, 1800.

I have had thoughts for days past of sending you a few lines, my beloved friend;
but being reduced very low, was discouraged.
I should be ungrateful, if I was not now and then to send a paper messenger,
after this sort, remembering the great kindness I have experienced at your hands,
and from your dear father and sisters.
Ah! my friend, I have been in the deeps since I parted from you, but underneath yet,
is the everlasting arm, or surely I had fainted.
A little relief has, been vouchsafed, for which my soul bows in thankfulness,
and receives it with a degree of trembling.

There is but little presents to write,
more than that I feel anxiously solicitous for your welfare
every way,--that you may deepen in religious experience;
that by descending into Jordan and there abiding, and rightly so,
you may yet be favoured to come up with your stones of living memorial.
You must experience the furnace; this is still the doctrine I have to hold forth to you,
and when I have seen you in it, my heart has sympathised,
and been more knit and united to you, than when in the greatest pleasantness and joy.
You have put your hand to the plough; go forward,
and the Lord redeem you from all that lets and hinders.

"`18th.--Set off after breakfast accompanied by William Hull and wife,
in a post chaise to London, in a low condition.

"`19th.--Started about six o'clock, and got to Dover about seven in the evening,
and met a kind reception from Richard Baker and wife.

"`20th, first-day.--To Folkstone meeting, and was silent in the morning;
in the afternoon many neighbours came, and I was much enlarged in communication,
and felt relieved.

"`21st.--To quarterly meeting; many neighbours came, and I had a tendering time.
Many tears, I believe, were dropped, and on the whole, the quarterly meeting, I hope,
was to profit.

"`22nd.--J. B. and wife came, and I had a tendering opportunity: he has been a soldier,
and was so when I was here last, and now attends meeting as well as his wife,
and they appear hopeful.
After these went away, S. T. eighty-two years old,
and another ancient woman came to see me, the latter,
the widow of the principal gunner at the battery.
It was pleasant to find so much love in the hearts of strangers.
Went to the meeting, which was very crowded, and I had a relieving time,
although much spent afterwards, but felt easy and relieved.

"`23rd.--Comforted respecting my dear mother, and also respecting my wife and family;
and desire to leave the things that are behind.
I remembered that passage, 'He shall not fail nor be discouraged,' etc.:
seeing then that help is laid on one so mighty, O, may I lay aside these weights,
and endeavour still to run the race before me with patience.
The promise of openness and enlargement while at Uxbridge,
has been fulfilled in several meetings.
After a seasonable opportunity with T. E. and wife,
and a tendering time with various Friends at our lodgings,
we left Folkstone and got into Dover to dinner, easy in mind.

"`Much freed from labour and toil of mind.
O how comfortable, and yet must I not learn in all states to be content.
Yes, I long for it, and to be able at all times, and on all occasions to say,
your will be done.
To meeting, which was small, but I felt considerable openness and enlargement.

"`25th.--I looked yesterday towards calling the town's people together in the evening,
but it left me.

"`26th.--But dull and low this evening; two days more spent,
and not one religious opportunity in a family; yet hope and trust I have not been idle.

"`27th, first-day.--Feed me with convenient food this day, and let your will be done.
Attended both meetings in silence: Richard Baker and daughter, and two others,
had the labour.
In the evening many friends called, and I felt openness towards various states,
and relieved my mind; I was again exercised in supplication at supper, and lay down easy.

"`28th.--Spent this day under close exercise.

"`29th.--See no opening towards the people at large,
nor anything to do in a more select manner.
Set off in a post chaise, and got to Rochester in the evening,
and met a kind reception at William Cowper's.

"`30th.--At meeting my soul was humbled into tears of contrition.
I remembered the first time I came to this place, and how I had to turn back to London,
and the singular occurrence which took place.
This is the fourth time I have been here, and some liberty of soul was experienced,
for which thankfulness was felt;
and towards the close of the meeting I had a tendering opportunity.

"`Fifth month 1st.--Met some friends at seven o'clock,
in order to get them reconciled one to another; again at ten o'clock,
and also at two o'clock, and in some good measure saw the end of our labour answered,
and feel comfortable now while making this note.
My mind is easy and faith renewed.

"`2nd.--Arose early and with an easy mind, finding no more to do here,
but an opportunity with Henry +++_______+++,
who attends meetings and appears sober and hopeful.
I am now again at Dartford, where I have been greatly afflicted in times past,
when my face has been turned towards London; it was so the last time I was here.
I had a pretty comfortable entry into London, and dined at Joseph Smith's,
whose kind notice and attention, with that of his wife,
had a tendency to comfort and cheer my mind; he went with me to John Bevans',
from which I took chaise and proceeded to Uxbridge.

"`3rd.--The language of my heart has been, 'Teach me your way, O Lord,
and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.'

"`4th, first-day.--Sweet and easy on awaking after a comfortable sleep.
My heart is thankful,
and desires to be preserved in watchfulness and resignation to the Divine will.
At meeting; I thought Ann Crowley appeared in a sweet and lively manner;
soon after which a dark cloud gathered in the outward heavens,
and spread with some thunder; and while I was on my feet the wind increased,
and hail stones came so powerfully against the window, etc.,
that the attention of some was turned away, and I sat down.
Silent in the afternoon meeting.

"`6th, third-day.--I have been reading and walking with an exercised mind;
and this precious thought is sweet, that I cannot do without affliction: I feel content.
Beautiful, indeed, does the creation appear this day.
In the midst of these pleasant pictures, I cast an eye on home, once my pleasant abode,
but from which I am now far separated, and in a stripped and tried condition.
It is the Lord, let him do what seems him good, let his will be done,
and all will work in the end for my good.

"`7th.--Was singularly concerned in communication in meeting to
address various states--last first-day's concern was revived.

"`10th.--I have been greatly tried with the veiling of the light of God's countenance,
for which I have long and often mourned in this land; but through it all,
what a favour not to lose all faith.
What has supported unto this day but goodness and mercy, though sometimes much hid.
I bless the name of the Lord, in that He is favouring me to believe in His name.
Surely I am yet a weak Christian, to mourn when tried, as I have done.
It is said of the eagle, that though ever so hungry, she makes no noise:
when will the time come that I shall bear all things, and hope all things.

"`13th.--Again at my friend Samuel Hull's, after a little visit to London.
I attended the burial of Sarah Row, the day before yesterday,
and was largely exercised in testimony at Devonshire house, where the corps was brought;
and again in the afternoon pretty much so at Grace-church street;
and some openness yesterday at the morning meeting, but have returned low and exercised;
it seems like a remand back to the prison-house.
Lord, help.

"`18th, first-day.--Mary Watson, and Mary Alexander, R. Fowler and wife,
with several others were at meeting, but not a line in the way of ministry.
My employment was to trace back my path to the first yearly meeting I attended;
and although I have been greatly tried since, in various ways,
I hope no wilful transgressions stand against me.
To afternoon meeting, in which I had not long sat down,
before my mind was favoured with an opening,
and brought into sympathy with the oppressed and exercised.
I remembered, and also mentioned, how gladdening it is to mariners at sea,
after being driven here and there by high winds, and having had many cloudy days,
so that no observation could be taken; when another ship, perhaps equally distressed,
may have been favoured with the sight of the sun, and taken an observation;
and when these meet at sea, and inquire what latitude and compare notes,
and gain some information, how joyfully they again proceed on their voyage.
What a joyful sound it was to the poor disciples, when the Master saluted them with,
all hail!

"`19th,
second-day.--Attended both of the sittings of the
yearly meeting of ministers and elders in London,
and was very poor.`"

The following letter was received from his friend Mary Dudley:--

Suirville near Clonmel, 18th of fifth month, 1800.

My much beloved friend,

How has your sympathising, your cordial salutation many weeks ago received,
been apparently neglected and unacknowledged;
but how different from appearance have been the real feelings of my heart, which,
burdened and longing for some relief, sought in vain for it.
Yet no ability has it found to pour forth its sorrows,
and such a restraint I know not that I ever
experienced from holding converse in this way,
so that I have for many months past,
been like an ungrateful receiver of many affectionate
tokens of unmerited regard from some near my best life.
The purgings of my poor tried spirit have been and continue unutterable: in this state,
sick in bed one morning, your valued lines met me, like deep uttering unto deep;
and was I not afraid to say, thankfulness was the covering of my mind,
stripped and divested as it feels of any sensible fruit of righteousness,
and every word sunk into an almost broken heart.

On your account, my long suffering brother, I could and did say, this has God wrought,
having introduced you into these afflictions,
and then causing you to partake of the consolations of the Gospel of his dear Son,
that thereby full conformity to Him might be effected,
and the purpose of His holy will through you wrought out.
Never did I question this would be the blessed
consequence of your deep and almost constant travail,
nor that the path of consecrated suffering would lead
to deeper unfoldings into the mystery of godliness;
and O! that whatever remains to be partaken of for your own and the church's good,
you may have in addition, the sustaining efficacy of continued everlasting love;
whatever becomes of your poor friend and little sister,
whose way is closed up on every side,
and in the depth of astonishment utters at seasons this language:
'Is Your mercy clean gone forever; wilt You be favourable no more?'
Your query, my dear friend, deeply penetrated my heart,
'What are you about!' Trying to stand against a host of difficulties within and without;
against a torrent of temptation (if it be so) from the adversary of all good;
often fearing I have introduced myself and others into an increase of suffering,
more than might have come in holy appointment, by overlooking the right time,
and by waiting for more light, when a sufficiency was vouchsafed;
or by not abiding where there was at seasons a gathering, even into that spot,
that longed-for state, where 'not my will but yours be done,' arises:
yet though often tossed in a manner not to be set forth,
gracious mercy withholds condemnation;
I feel not the dreadful weight of reproach from an ever-loving Father,
but at times a hope, that feeling a degree of resignation,
and not standing opposed to His revealed will,
He will either in abundant mercy accept the imperfect sacrifice,
or in His own way and time burst my bonds, and proclaim liberty to the captive.
If I am just lifted out of the dungeon with any little message to the people,
and while in commission the vessel feels a little strength,
soon is it gone and darkness covers the earth,
as though the sun would no more shine upon me.

I am here in this land of commotion and bloodshed, a suffering stranger,
to my own feeling, weaned as I long since told you (in the confidence I felt) from it,
and looking to a residence on the other side of the water,
when a detention (very unexpectedly) of several months in the last year,
confirmed my feelings in its being the best for us all.
Self, and what attaches to it,
has driven me farther than I had any view of when I sat down;
but it has not so fully occupied, as to hide you and your views, my beloved brother,
from my sight.
Much do I long to know how you are likely to be disposed of;
and O how should I be comforted by a little of your society,
previous to a separation by the great deep; at one time it looked rather probable,
that at this season I might be so indulged, but that is over,
and I can only hope through your own kind pen to know whether
a peaceful retreat has been sounded in your ears:
if so, may the Lord go with you,
and His Spirit give you rest--preserve on the mighty waters,
and restore you to your endeared connections with the joy of harvest,
and unbroken sheaves of soul-enriching peace.
I would request your kind host and wife, Joseph and Rachel Smith,
to accept my and my Robert Dudley's love, and your dear country folk near you.
I shall hope, little as I deserve it,
for a line from you when your case is determined as to moving or staying.`"

"`Sixth month 14th.--I am now again at my friend J. H.'s, Uxbridge;
many days have passed since I made any record;--have got through the
yearly meeting with a pretty comfortable share of health and strength,
and trust I laboured to be found in my proper allotment:
although trying things have occurred,
yet it has been thought on the whole the most solid meeting ever remembered.
What a favour,
what a consolation to see the church advancing as out of the
wilderness! this I think my eyes have seen since being in this land,
and have rejoiced in it.
I left London under pressure of soul;
and thought on sitting down in the meeting at Brentford, a few days since,
that my state resembled a field laid open without fence or wall;
and under this sense I wept much,
and continued weeping until I felt strength to bend in fervent supplication;
and afterwards by some communication, got much relief.
Sweet was the calmness that covered my mind for a season,
while sitting in the men's meeting,
which in some degree continued through the remainder of the day.
Here I am again, shut up a prisoner, but not altogether without hope,
though I have had a deep plunge since returning.

"`16th.--Week-day meeting was a humbling one; my faith was renewed in silent travail,
and I was favoured with openings.
The Lord continue his good hand upon me,
and enable me to believe and put my trust in him, and to wait on him.
Humbling prospects opened a little to my view respecting the king and London,
and I lay down resigned to whatever allotment Divine Providence may permit.

"`23rd.--London quarterly meeting of ministers and elders was but a flat dull time,
and the general quarterly meeting, held on the 24th,
was a very low time in the first part:
I feared there was not a digging for the fresh springs of life;
and throughout the business there seemed very little life stirring.
Is it not a sifting, proving time, in which the prudent men keep silence.

"`26th.--Had a trying time on my bed;
the state of society and individuals pressed me sorely.

"`29th, first-day.--Empty and poor on awaking; yet hope, in prostration and abasement,
I felt desirous to subscribe to the Lord's will.
I long to experience his favour,
and the lifting up of the precious light of life in my soul,
and to feel more liberty of spirit.
I long to see the way home, how and when;
and yet I desire also to lay abased and humbled,
so as to be willing to be dashed to pieces, and yet more broken,
if it is the Lord's blessed will; believing his power is able to make me up anew.
Attended both meetings, and was shut up in silent sorrow.

"`Seventh month 1st.--To Southwark meeting, in which I felt a concern to labour,
and it was to some satisfaction.

"`3rd.--Awoke about one o'clock, and it was a very singular time of opening prospects;
and thanks be to God,
my mind was brought into resignation and willingness to submit to his will--perhaps
I hardly ever had a clearer opening into the agony of my Saviour in the garden,
and also his crucifixion; he emptied himself--he stooped to the cross,
and who can declare his generation, for his life was taken from the earth.

"`6th, first-day.--Attended Grace-church street meeting, and dined at Wilson Birkbeck's,
accompanied by Ann Crowley,
and after dinner my mind was turned towards the son in a particular manner,
and afterwards to the goodly old Friend, the grand mother;
and M. Bevans closed the opportunity by prayer for the youth.^
footnote:[Who died soon after.]
To Grace-church street meeting again in the afternoon, and sat it in painful silence.

"`7th.--Received a letter from Samuel Smith; he, Richard Jordan,
and Gerves Johnson arrived at Liverpool the 3rd of this month.
Attended a special meeting today on account of Hannah Barnard.^
footnote:[Hannah Barnard, who resided in the State of New York,
was an acknowledged minister in the Society of Friends,
possessed of talents considerably above the ordinary level,
with a force of imagination and power of language which were
quite attractive to her youthful and inexperienced hearers.
Yet some of the more discerning and considerate class regarded her,
as one (to use an old but expressive phrase) who was carrying more sail than ballast.
She came to Great Britain as a minister with proper certificates from America,
but during her travels developed unsoundness in doctrine,
similar to those opinions which had just before been
manifested in Ireland +++[+++i.e. denying the Godhead of Christ,
His propitiatory sacrifice,
the Divine authority and inspiration of the Scriptures of truth, etc.]
Her case obtained the attention of the Morning Meeting in London,
which took proper steps to prevent her further traveling in the ministry;
and she was dealt with for her unscriptural opinions.
She appealed against the disciplinary proceedings which
had become necessary in thus restricting her,
to the yearly meeting in 1801; which, after a weighty and solemn deliberation,
decided against her;
and she was ultimately disowned as a member of our religious society
by the monthly meeting in America to which she belonged.
A few were carried away by the plausibility of her public addresses,
during her stay in England:
but they were in several instances known to be unsatisfactory
to those of other religious denominations,
as well as to Friends.]
I have felt more ease of spirit these two days past, and have rested on my bed,
for which thankfulness of heart is experienced.

"`12th.--Had a tender opportunity with one I longed to see.
Packed up my things in trunks and saddle bags, and now I have said in my heart,
what wait I for, but the signature and seal of permission to go home.
Spent the evening quiet and easy, and lay down so, insomuch as to adopt this language:
'You are my Father; you are my Judge, and my Law-giver; you are my King,
and you wilt save me.'
O for faith to hold fast such a confidence as this.

"`13th.--Still feel a comfortable reviving degree of faith and hope;
O may it give courage and boldness.
Two open times in meeting today, to my admiration.

"`14th.--Attended morning meeting in London, which was exercising,
and yet I was favoured to bear up under complicated trials.

In the evening answered George Dillwyn's letter, which is as follows:

Tottenham, seventh month 14th, 1800.

My beloved friend,

Since your letter was put into my hands at the close of the meeting this morning,
I have been looking it over again and again, musing and pondering its contents;
and the more I think of it and of you, my dear feeling brother,
the more I am induced to believe you were assisted with
best help to pour a little oil into these wounds,
that I have sometimes ventured to believe, were made as by fetters of iron;
for on looking over the precious encouraging portion of scripture you sent,
and turning my eyes to the margin, I there read,
'His soul came into iron;' and I gained instruction thereby.
How I have longed, both in lonely places in the day time,
and upon my bed in the night season,
when almost every brook or stream of comfort was dried up, that the King immortal,
and everlastingly glorious, might be pleased to loose my imprisoned spirit,
and let me go free; therefore, to this little portion which you sent me,
with the greatest sincerity I can say.
Amen.

You are, I think, just right with respect to comparing,
or bringing us back to youthful days, I was a diver,
and you and I have had our dips under the water together,
since the day we met in this land.
How singular, and yet how comfortable was it, on reading your lines,
to remember afresh the thoughts of my heart respecting you,
within these few days past--they came up somewhat after this manner;
for I may assure you, I have had a very deep plunge:
'There is my friend and brother George Dillwyn, who appears to be bearing me company,
and seems like another Ezekiel; he has prepared his stuff, and has removed;
he has had a singular life in this land, much like mine; he has returned again,
and though settled as to appearance--and though I am separated from wife and children,
etc., yet he appears like one bound as I am.
I have seen him as a mark that has been shot at, arid the archers have wounded him.'
From thoughts like these my mind was brought into near fellowship with you;
was not this like diving under the water, and touching?
Can you recollect that we can see one another under water, when we cannot speak?
I have often wanted to say more to you, but when with you have been restrained.

I was at Tottenham yesterday,
and in both meetings favoured with enlargement in testimony;
it seemed like a farewell service,
and afforded much comfort and relief to my mind And now I may conclude by assuring you,
that no part of your precious letter was more sweet than the close,
whereby you felt liberty to own me as a brother
in the sympathy and fellowship of the gospel:
and as far as I dare venture in this my imprisoned state,
I can dearly salute you in a measure of the same.

Thomas Scattergood.

"`15th.--Awoke early, and the situation of Hannah Barnard awoke with me,
and pressed hard on my mind; which, with other prospects relating to myself,
brought me into prostration and tears.

"`20th, first-day.--To Grace-church street meeting, which was silent on my part:
dined at S. Southall's, and had a tendering opportunity with the family.
To Grace-church street meeting at three o'clock, and had a comfortable time in prayer,
and afterwards in testimony, particularly toward the dear youth.
Slept into William Allen's and took some refreshment;
here I met with my dear sympathizing friend Joseph Gurney Bevan,
much to my comfort and refreshment.
To Devonshire house at five o'clock, where the body of the widow Elliott was brought;
it was a large and mixed meeting, and very unsettled.
H+++.+++ B. pretty soon stood up to define the difference between a wise man and a fool.
Special West afterward preached salvation only by and through faith in Christ,
received by faith in the heart--it was a trying time.

"`23rd.--What a mercy to be favoured with a little ease of spirit!
My soul longs for deliverance from this great city;
yet I trust in the Lord's way and time.
O for greater sanctification of spirit and purity of heart,
so as to be favoured to see God, to know his will and do it.

"`24th.--The situation of afflicted Job opened last night on my bed:
how stripped was he of all his living, and reduced to lie on a dunghill,
or to sit among ashes.
Surely in a spiritual sense he could say, he had eaten ashes like bread.
Soon after breakfast Mary Pryor came from Hartford to see me.
In a little sitting she told me how much her thoughts were
with me as she sat in her week-day meeting yesterday,
and therefore wanted to see me; that it had passed through her mind,
and with much fear and care she mentioned it: 'You are my servant;
I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction; I will keep you in all places,
whithersoever you go.'
Soon after this opportunity I received a letter
from Uxbridge with nearly the same expressions.
I dropped my tears, and was willing to say, So be it, good Lord.

"`27th.--I felt some openness in both meetings, especially that in the morning,
with the rich and gay, and felt relief.

"`29th.--To a meeting of ministers and elders called on my account,
where I opened my prospects of returning home.
A committee was appointed to prepare an endorsement for my certificate.
It was a comfortable time,--I found sympathizers.
After meeting I opened to a few Friends another weighty concern,
respecting visiting the king.

"`31st.--Set off in a post chaise about eight o'clock,
accompanied by my friends Richard Chester and John Elliott, for Weymouth,
to endeavour to obtain an interview with the king.
Got on our way about sixty-six miles to Winchester: I felt quiet and resigned on the way,
and pretty cheerful.

"`Eighth month 1st.--Got to our journey's end, starting about six o'clock,
and arrived about sunset, seventy miles.
My weakness, and great infirmity stared me full in the face, and it was trying.
I felt very unworthy this day, but endeavoured to look forward.

"`2nd.--Waited until near eleven o'clock before
anything opened to make way for my concern.
In the evening Richard Chester and John Elliott
walked on the esplanade and met with the king,
and requested for me an opportunity with him, his consort, etc., but got no answer;
they were kindly noticed.
During their absence my mind was closely exercised, being left alone at the inn.
Sometime after they returned I walked to the pier-head, and looked toward the sea,
and deep and pensive were my thoughts respecting this island and its inhabitants.

"`3rd, first-day.--Endeavoured to put on strength, I hope, in the divine Arm:
about eight o'clock, accompanied by my two friends, I walked along the sea shore,
and saw the king with several of his officers, walking the esplanade.
On their return we met them, and I had a full opportunity to ease my mind.
Returned to the inn peaceful and easy as I could wish or desire;
and about ten o'clock set off and rode this day about halfway back towards London.`"

It will be proper to observe,
that in the interview which his companions had with one of the king's advisers,
to whom they had applied for permission to visit him,
they were informed that it was not likely he would consent; alledging as a reason,
his unwillingness to see any strangers,
in consequence of attempts which had recently been made upon his life.
He however suggested,
that as he regularly walked on the esplanade at a certain time in the day,
they might have an opportunity then, if they thought that would answer.

When they met,
Thomas Scattergood was introduced to the king as
a much loved minister of the gospel from America,
who had been engaged in a religious visit to the Society of Friends in England.
Thomas then took off his hat and said, "`I have a message from the Lord to you, O king.`"
The king instantly uncovered his head, also his attendants,
and made a full stop at this salutation,
and listened with respectful attention to what Thomas said.
When he concluded, the king said to him,
"`I thank you,`"--and instead of pursuing his walk, returned at once to his apartment.

"`4th.--Dined at Egham near Staines.
On entering the room I saw a Bible laying on the table,
and opened on the twenty-ninth chapter of Isaiah, and felt encouraged in reading it,
for my mind has been closely exercised respecting
another prospect which has long been upon my mind.
Got into London about six o'clock: the last ten miles stage into London was a trying one;
and it has often been so on entering this place, but this exceeds all,
from a prospect of mortifying service opening and pressing very heavily upon my mind.

"`6th.--Slept pretty well, and I feel cheerfully resigned, I hope,
to do what has opened as a religious duty.
Met a number of Friends at Grace-church street meeting-house,
and laid before them a prospect of going to the Royal exchange.
It was a solid, uniting time, and I found sympathizers:
none could see their way to accompany me in the exercise,
and as the way did not open in their minds, I got eased of my burden, and left it.
Attended meeting, which was pretty large, and many young people present.
I began with some expressions which I heard T. Gawthrop dropped on leaving Philadelphia:
'Master said, you came poor amongst them, be content to leave them so.'
Tenderness appeared in the meeting, and after it was over I was saluted by many,
old and young.
Went to Tottenham to lodge.

"`7th.--After breakfast I took my farewell of this very kind family,
(Thomas Horne's,) and went to London to the Alien-office, and after waiting some time,
got my passport.
Dined at J. Bevans' with a number of Friends, Joseph Bevans and wife amongst them,
and after a tendering time with a pretty large circle, set off,
and accompanied by my kind friends E. Janson and sister, Martha Horne, in a post chaise,
and J. Bevans, wife and son, to Uxbridge, where several called in and took leave.

"`8th.--An opportunity with several Friends, and started about half past six o'clock,
and breakfasted at Adey Bellamy's, High Wiccomb,
where dear George Dillwyn and wife met us.
We had another opportunity, and passed on through Oxford, Chippingnorton to Skipton,
and on the 9th as far as Newcastle and lodged.

"`10th.--Got to John Bludwich's, at Warrington, about two o'clock,
and to meeting with them at three, and about five set off,
and arrived at Liverpool a little after dark, where I met with Joseph and Rachel Smith,
and pretty soon after I got in,
was informed that Phebe Speakman had sailed early in the morning of this day,
which gave me a little shock for a moment; but felt easy in a belief it is well.

"`11th.--Spent this morning at Robert Benson's,
and in the afternoon went on board S. Coflin's ship,
and sat down with a number of Friends in quiet,
I told the company I felt easy to go in this vessel,
and cast myself on divine Providence; that I had been a prisoner for years in this land,
and this ship seemed like removing into a small compass, etc.

"`13th.--No prospect of sailing for several days, and I feel content.

"`16th.--I feel at liberty to cross the great deep again,
and to look towards my native land.
Surely I may say this morning, I feel myself an unworthy creature;
yet I hope I desire to trust in God for mercy, deliverance and salvation:
grant it may be so, and my soul yet more humbled and abased in truth.

"`17th, first-day.--Am yet at Liverpool.
There is occasion to lie humble, as with my mouth in the dust.
Went to meeting and prayed for myself and others, after which I felt a little lightened.
In the afternoon meeting I laboured, and bid farewell, and felt more ease of spirit.
It has been a hurrying time of late.
O for sustaining comfort to accompany on board of ship, and over the sea.
I hope my views are not great; quiet and ease of mind,
and a sense of forgiveness of all my weakness, infirmities and iniquity;
I desire to trust.

"`18th.--Better in health and spirits; wrote to several friends,
and feel relieved and lightened.

"`19th.--A prospect of sailing was given out last night,
and my mind became more fully charged, and did not sleep so well as nights past.
After breakfast sat down in Robert Benson's parlour, with him, wife and children,
Joseph and Rachel Smith, E. Janson, Martha Horne, etc., when a quiet, and I trust,
a solemnity covered us: it was the testimony of Robert Benson it was so,
and after we broke up, Robert Benson also expressed the same.
I wept in the opportunity, but felt resigned to my allotment,
believing the time was come to leave this land, and expressed it:
when we got down with my sea stores, the ship was getting out of the dock;
the pilot would not come to,
and so we were under the necessity of taking a
boat and following her a considerable distance,
which was trying, as I wanted some of my dear friends to have gone on board with me.
Parted with them at the pier-head, much as I parted from Friends in New York,
and accompanied by Robert Sutcliff, of Sheflield, the only cabin passenger,
got safely on board about eleven o'clock, and after sailing about thirty miles,
anchored until night.

"`20th.--Fair wind but light: my heart feels heavy at times,
not only in looking towards shore, but also to my native land:
great have been my conflicts since I left New York, to which place I am now bound,
if the Lord permit; unto whose keeping and care I crave ability to commit body,
soul and spirit, as into the hands of a merciful Creator,
for there appears nothing to recommend me, a poor unworthy servant, but mercy in Christ.
O then let me settle down into it.
O my God, visit and revisit my soul; cast me not out of your presence.
I am weak, and have been greatly loaded with infirmity.
Look once more on my afflictions and my pains,
and forgive all my sins--keep my soul and deliver me,
let me not be ashamed and confounded;
for I dare not do otherwise than put my trust in you, and believe and hope in you.

"`Two o'clock.--Fresh wind and fair, and a fine day: not far from Holyhead.
I look at Wales with love,
a part of the island I have not visited in this long detention in this land.
O that the seed may be visited and cared for.

"`22nd.--I have felt lively sensations on looking towards my dear friends parted from,
and to whom I am going.
Even in these few day's tossing, I may adopt David's language;
'Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
When I said my foot slipped, your mercy, O Lord, held me up.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.'

"`25th.--O how pleasant and how desirable is it to be continued under divine favour,
and to be acknowledged as one of the Lord's servants.
Had a refreshing night's sleep,
and awoke with a degree of courage and confidence in the divine Arm,
You can change the wilderness of great trial into a fruitful field, at your pleasure.
I crave ability to wait on you, my Creator and Preserver, I opened the blessed book,
and cast my eyes again on the ninety-first Psalm; 'I will say of the Lord,
he is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in him will I trust,'

"`27th.--A calm night, and now the wind has shifted to S. W.,
and it is a very fine morning: my mind is calm, and I feel pretty easy in my allotment.
I trust I have been favoured to come off in the right time:
never did I see the way open before.
It is the Lord alone who can heal the broken in heart, and bind up their wounds.

"`31st, first-day.--A brisk wind this morning, but increased in the afternoon,
so as to require the topsails to be reefed.
I sat on deck most of the day,
the sailors having put up a piece of a sail on the quarter rail to break off the wind.
When I saw the sailors on the yards taking in sail, so exposed to danger,
I thought surely the watchful eye that is over the sparrow,
is also over them to preserve them; the thought was sweet,
and love flowed in my heart towards them, although no opening for a meeting presented.

"`Ninth month 1st.--The wind increased to a storm last night,
and between ten and twelve o'clock the ship lay to.
The captain ordered the dead lights put in, and it was well he did,
as he afterwards said; for although the ship lay easy yet the wind dying away suddenly,
and then shifting to an opposite point, she got into the trough of the sea,
and at times the waves beat against the stern, and would have washed us in the cabin,
if this precaution had not been taken.
Got under sail again in the morning, but had a very heavy sea.

"`2nd.--There was a time during this long detention in Great Britain,
when the waves of the sea appeared terrible and insurmountable;
so did the prospect of being captured at sea: now they are very little to me, no fear,
even the night before last, in the greatest seeming trial, possessed my mind.

"`3rd.--I have been instructed this day by observing
the weather and outward elements on this wide sea,
which surely resembles my life of ups and downs.
This morning, after I came out of my little confined cabin, upon deck,
the clouds were thick, the wind ahead, and it was oppressively close.
In a little time the wind came more northerly, a pleasant, clear horizon appeared,
and a cool, refreshing air sprung up.
I wait on Him who holds the winds in his fists, to change my spiritual dispensation.

"`4th.--Spoke the ship Rose from Philadelphia for Liverpool, twenty-one days out.
I feel thankful that my mind is so easy and quiet.
O for a day of liberty to serve God without slavish fear.
I long for more of such a dispensation; 'My life, if you preserve my life,
your sacrifice shall be.'
I trust this is the upright language of my tribulated soul; desirous to say.
Not mine, but your will, O God, be done today, and to the end of my days here,
and forever.

"`6th.--Beating against the wind--how much this
resembles my track through this vale of tears.
'You have need of patience after you have done the will of God, to receive the promise.'

"`8th.--It is a favour worthy of recording,
that I feel so quiet and resigned in my present allotment,
and that I can sleep so well in the night season,
with little care upon me as to the voyage; thanks be rendered where they are due.

"`18th.--About sunrise it began to blow; we soon had a very heavy wind, and lay to.
I enjoy a calm and easy mind in the midst of a storm.
O London, London,
what unutterable conflicts have I passed through in walking your streets!
Now, even when the waves run high, and stormy winds rage,
so as to make the sea like a boiling pot,
my spirit is at rest and centred in the Creator of sea and land.
Bless his name, O my soul.

"`22nd.---Last evening before night, put the ship about, and laid our course south,
with very little west--the captain thought it best to stand no further north:
between seven and eight o'clock this morning lay the ship to,
and the hands went to fishing, we being on the Banks.
I remembered, I hope, instructively and encouragingly this language;
'God spared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all.'
O the mystery of the redemption of lost man!
Great is the mystery of the work of Truth.
About ten o'clock put the ship about on the starboard tack, and lay a N. W. course by W.,
with a light wind.
Our fresh cod-fish dinner was very grateful.

"`24th.--A calm covered my mind on awaking this morning,
and continues with a revival of faith and hope.
A little after twelve o'clock, as we were sitting at dinner, it suddenly began to rain,
the first mate sprang from his seat, saying,
'What's this,'--he found the wind had suddenly died away,
and a squall came up from the north.
The helmsman was confused, and put the helm the wrong way: the hands were all at dinner,
except the helmsman and the cook.
There was such a stir on deck as quickly sent up the captain: I followed,
and was sensible of the difficulty, seeing so much sail out; however,
by keeping the ship before the wind, for the captain took the helm,
the sailors got in sail,
and by this time the wind got round to N. E. Went under a close reeled topsail,
foresail and main-topsail,
and in a little time were sailing at the rate of eight or nine knots.
When the captain and mate came down to finish their dinner,
he remarked he had never been caught so suddenly before,
for when he left the deck there was no such appearance.
I felt thankful that my mind was so calm and easy in this bustle: poor sailors,
what a wet condition they were in, and how cheerfully they went to their work.

"`28th, first-day.--I have been walking the deck;
and a number of my dear friends left behind have come nearly into remembrance.
I have been thinking of holding a meeting with the ship's company, both yesterday,
and also upon my pillow, and since getting up, but do not feel an opening.

"`Tenth month 3rd.--The wind continued brisk
until between eleven and twelve o'clock at night,
and then suddenly came round to N. W. There was a bustle on deck: I dressed and went up,
and found we had stood on within six or seven miles of Long Island.
It being moonlight we could see it plainly,
and a sweet smell like fresh hay regaled our senses: the sailors caught a woodpecker,
blown off, no doubt, by the north-wester.
We are now, after breakfast, out of sight of Long Island:
what joy was manifest last night among the mariners on sight of land.
I felt calm and easy, and when at breakfast this morning,
some were speaking of the head wind taking us, I felt resigned,
and expressed that I felt at home, and had been so since coming on board this ship;
and yet I have been and am a tried man,
and frequently have broken forth in this confinement in the language of the Psalmist,
the type of the suffering Saviour--the type of the church under her trials also:
'How long wilt you forget me, O Lord; forever?
how long wilt you hide your face from me?
how long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?
how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and hear me, O Lord my God: enlighten my eyes,
lest I sleep the sleep of death--lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him,
and those that trouble me, rejoice when I am moved.'
Then let me trust in your mercy, that I may have yet to rejoice in your salvation, O God.
We have been beating all day opposite Black Point, wind right ahead.

"`4th.--About three o'clock this morning a pilot came on board,
and now we are beating up with a small head wind.
I am once more in sight of my native land,
and to all appearance delivered from the dangers of the sea,
I feel at the present moment a poor unworthy creature, abashed and humbled,
and yet I trust there is a tribute of thanksgiving arises unto the Lord,
for favours vouchsafed on the mighty waters;
and it seems as if I must go home as I left it, in a humbled condition: well,
the divine will be done, and mine reduced--so be it.
Got up to New York about nine o'clock; came to anchor,
and soon after the captain ordered the boat and took Robert Sutcliff and myself ashore.
On the wharf I was met by my kind friend Isaac Collins, who had been watching for me,
and conducted me home with him, where I had an open reception,
and before bed time a sweet religious opportunity; forty-seven days on the voyage.

"`5th, first-day.--To both meetings, and felt openness to labour tenderly.
My heart was broken, and mine eyes flowed with tears.
Friends appeared glad to see me, several of whom I visited in the course of the day,
and had a remarkable opportunity with J. M. and daughter, at Isaac Collins'.

"`6th, second-day.--Spent considerable of this day in getting through the custom house, etc.

"`7th.--After breakfast went on board ship with Robert Sutcliff and
distributed some little presents amongst the sailors,
and had also an opportunity to relieve my mind.
Dined at R. Pearsall's, and soon after set off with Isaac Collins in his chaise,
and got as far as Rahway.

"`8th.--Several friends called in this morning, and we had a religious opportunity;
then proceeded as far as Stonybrook, where I met my father David Bacon, and son Joseph.

"`9th.--Left our carriage and horses at Bristol, went over to Burlington and dined,
and got home after night.`"

After returning from England he remained mostly at his own residence until 1801,
not being called to any religious service out of his native city,
except an occasional visit to neighbouring quarterly or other meetings.

As he kept no memorandums during this period, little further is known respecting him,
than what is contained in the following extracts of letters:

Addressed to a Friend in England.

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 5th, 1800.

My dear friend,

I trust the time had come for me to leave that land;
and though I left my beloved friends at the pier-head with my heart full,
yet the watery element was made easy to me; yes,
more so than at one time I could believe.
O what fears dwelt on my mind at seasons on looking toward the ocean,
with desires to be going when there was no clearance: then it was terrible indeed,
as also when I thought of going as a prisoner to France, in such a sifted,
tried condition.
If I could hardly bear up amongst such feeling, sympathizing friends as I had in England,
I thought, what should I do amongst strangers,
to be a prisoner spiritually and outwardly.
All these cogitations and fears were removed; and though I had very humbling thoughts,
and tossings of mind at times during the voyage,
it was as prosperous as I could wish for.
I landed at New York in forty-seven days from Liverpool,
and met a kind reception in that place.

I had no opportunity in the way of meetings during the voyage; I could not get at it.
I was very poor;
but before I left New York I went on board ship and had a full opportunity with mates,
sailors, cabin boys and cook, all together, to much satisfaction,
and I have cause to believe they love me.

And now I may tell you,
that the desire of my heart continues for your
preservation and advancement in the way everlasting.
Put on the breast plate of faith,
and follow the Captain of your salvation fully and perfectly.
There is need to be girt about; and if I mistake not, there will yet be more need.
O, it is a comfort to me to believe, to be assured you are not of the company,
nor in the least joined with those, who are denying a crucified Saviour,
and setting up something else instead.
Keep down in the quiet habitation,
and be willing to be baptised with the baptism of Christ,
that so your feet may be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,
that you may be able to travel through and over all the rough ways and stony places,
that may yet be cast up for the proving of your faith;
so wilt you honour the Lord with your all, and in and through all,
in being faithful to fulfil your duty, not only at home in your own particular meeting,
but to know when to go forth in little services, and how to move and conduct in them.
The Lord be near to you in all,
and guide you safely through all that he may be pleased to permit you to pass through,
and give you at last to sit down in the kingdom of peace and rest,
and grant that our spirits may unite in bliss.

I am comforted in observing one here and there of the female sex,
under the polishing hand, that are as plants sprung up since I have been away,
bright and clear in testimony for the Truth, who have been moving about,
and still continue to move, I trust as clouds waiting to be filled by him,
that sees to the ends of the earth, and looks under the whole heaven,
to make the weight for the wind, and brings it out of his treasury.

O what a spectacle I have been among you;
what an exercised creature--what lonely walks have I had in fields and gardens!
Was ever anyone so before?
Well, when I ponder and think,
and it is very likely I have sometimes done too much at this,
and I am striving to mend in this respect; I say, sometimes I query,
whether I could wish it should have been otherwise, and hardly dare say I do.
I am again amongst my own people,
and pray to be sustained by a few crumbs from the bountiful table; and may tell you,
my friend, that I have been able to come at little further at times,
both in meetings and out of them, than to breathe forth this mournful language;
'have mercy on me, O Lord, and forgive all my weakness and infirmity,
and blot out all my iniquities, and favour with a place amongst your sons and daughters,
for I feel myself an unworthy and unprofitable servant;
and if all or any part of the deep sorrow I have passed through may stand in your sight,
it is all but little, and no more than a debt due.'

I have no other view in thus writing, than that perhaps it may give some relief,
by a little vent to one who has often seen me inclosed as in the pit,
when the poor exile has been hastening not to die therein.
What will be the amount of all this?
I was deeply plunged before I offered to visit
the miserable in London--not for days or weeks:
long was it on my mind.
Long was I troubled in walking London streets.
The last exercise that I mentioned to Friends, was peculiarly singular;
but I have felt quiet and easy about it, and sometimes have thought,
that were I now in London, it is so gone, that I should feel different.
I love her inhabitants, and have been ready to say within myself since I got home,
and thought and said so among you; Surely they are not the worst of people,
there is much good; 'much that I love, and more that I admire.'

Farewell, says one who prays you may be kept and preserved in and through all states,
which wisdom may see fit to permit, and remain your affectionate friend,

Thomas Scattergood.

The following is taken from a letter addressed to him, by his friend Ann Crowley, dated,

Ann Crowley to Thomas Scattergood

Uxbridge, Eighth month 13th, 1801.

Beloved friend, Thomas Scattergood,

As much time has elapsed since your departure from this land,
it may seem rather unseasonable to remark,
the satisfaction and comfort we experienced in hearing
of your safe arrival on your native shore,
and that a portion of the blessed legacy given to the disciples of old,
was vouchsafed at the winding up of your arduous labour.
Ah! my friend, I have not forgotten the many baptisms, the sore conflicts,
which attended your deeply exercised mind,
while engaged in the Master's service on this side the Atlantic;
they are profitably imprinted on my mind, and I trust,
lessons of great instruction were learned by some of us,
in reading your example of silent suffering with the seed of the kingdom.
What signifies how large a portion of suffering falls to our lot,
while conflicting with the clogs of humanity, if through all,
we are but made useful in the furtherance of the
work of the Lord in the hearts of his children;
it is a blessed experience to know assuredly, the virtue and efficacy of that baptism,
which crucifies the will of the creature, nails it to the cross, and reduces self,
until it becomes of no reputation; here the Lord alone is glorified,
his excellent name exalted, and his church edified.
It is good for us frequently to know a being buried with Christ in baptisms,
in order that we may experience renewed qualification
to preach his resurrection and life.
If, in the wisdom of truth,
it should be the lot of my endeared friend and father in the church,
to be again plunged into many tribulations,
let him keep in remembrance for his encouragement, that tribulation works patience,
and patience experience, and experience hope, which makes not ashamed;
because the love of God is shed abroad in the heart.
It is those that are willing to abide with their
spiritual feet fixed on the bottom of Jordan,
until the Lord calls them forth,
that are enabled to bring up stones of memorial to his praise.
Let us then unitedly thank God,
in that he has thought us worthy to suffer for his
blessed cause of truth and righteousness sake.

I write not thus from feeling a redundancy of good in my heart,
or that it is a time of feasting; no, verily, the Lord only knows the many trials,
discouragements, and mournful exercises, that attend my mind; but I thought a cheering,
animating language seemed due to your feeling spirit; believing,
without any manner of doubt, that your deep conflicts will redound to the honour of God,
and your own perfect purification;
so that if true patience is permitted to have its perfect work,
you wilt most assuredly have to adopt the language of an eminent apostle,
near the close of time, 'I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith,
I have finished my course; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me at that day.'
I never could let go the hope, that you would through all;
be favoured to know your bonds broken,
and liberty proclaimed to return in safety to your near kindred after the flesh,
carrying sheaves of enriching peace with you,
which would be so manifested to your fellow believers,
that they would have no room to doubt,
but you had been employed in doing the Master's will;
and my heart is made to rejoice in the persuasion that this was the case,
and now solid satisfaction is your blessed enjoyment.
We have abundant cause to be thankful that our lot was cast amongst tender care-takers;
but O, the poverty which I feel, of a real sense of true gratitude of heart,
which ought to ascend to the Father and Fountain of all good.

As I believe you are interested in our welfare, I may inform you,
that although we often set in low places,
experiencing the immortal spring of life to be exceedingly deep,
and little ability to drawwater out of the well of salvation;
yet such is the condescending goodness of a gracious God,
that he is pleased at seasons to own us by the fresh incomes of his life-giving presence,
which melts the heart into humble contrition,
so that we have been unitedly enabled to say,
the Lord is still remembering the very dust of Zion,
and willing to satisfy all her poor with bread.
I have not been out with a certificate since we parted with you,
but have attended some neighbouring quarterly, monthly and other meetings,
accompanied mostly by our mutually beloved friend John Hull,
who I feel increasingly bound to, in the covenant of love and life,
believing he is deepening in the immortal root of life.
I feel much sympathy for him, knowing his baptisms to be many; but have no doubt,
if he patiently abide under these conflicts, his bonds will yet be broken,
and he will be enabled to come forth as gold seven times purified,
fitted and prepared to declare of the Lord's wonders experienced in the deeps.
I am about leaving home, once more to engage in the Master's service.
O the awfulness of such an engagement;
how does the prospect frequently weigh down my spirit into fear and trembling,
lest through any degree of unwatchfulness the work of the Lord should be marred.
Beloved friend, let me beseech you, when favoured to approach the throne of grace,
to put up your secret petition,
that the blessing of preservation may be mine through all the remainder of my pilgrimage;
that so the Lord's name may be glorified, and my peace established forever.`"

Thomas Scattergood to Ann Crowley

Philadelphia, Eleventh month 29th, 1801.

Your letter, my beloved friend, came safely to hand a few days ago,
and as the ship Rose is to sail in a few days for London,
I was not easy to let slip the opportunity of telling you so.

I still feel interested in your concerns, and felt a wish, when I read your lines,
and frequently since, that you may witness preservation on the right ground;
and shall I add, let patience have its perfect work.
This is a great word for me in my present emptied state to adopt,
or recommend to another; but I know that we all have need of patience,
even after doing all that we see to be our duty, that we may receive the promise.
Is it not enough to wait day by day for the unfoldings of required duty and be faithful.
It is a great thing to be faithful, and manifest our allegiance even in the fire.
There is many a pang of conflict to be passed through,
previous to going forth into a fresh field of labour.
The vision may be for an appointed time, and this must be waited for:
some by over anxiety, have, it is to be feared, even dared to hasten,
or strive to hasten.
I am ready to say, why write I thus?
I had little or nothing to make a beginning with, and even this day,
such has been my reduced state,
that I was thinking of closing my correspondence with my friends on your side,
for a time, having so little to spare; but truly I love numbers in that land.

Twelfth month 3rd.--You have manifested much sympathy
and love towards me on various occasions,
and I often remember it and you.
Did you ever see me much more reduced, perplexed and troubled on every side,
than in the tour from Liverpool towards London, excepting the season previous to,
and about the time of receiving such mournful intelligence in ninth and tenth months,
1798?
My faith, hope, confidence, patience, and all that I once thought I was in possession of,
was tried to the very bottom and foundation.
Surely, often then and since, I have been ready to say, how has my foolishness appeared.
Lord, extend your mercy--I often begged for it.

I feel willing to turn back again with a mind possessed with earnest
desires for your safe guidance through this vale of uncertainty,
tears and sorrow; that you may be favoured so to dwell with your gift,
as to be enabled to get your work done in the day time,
by labouring to keep the single eye.
This will be your preservation through all storms and tempests;
this will show you what state in life will be most pleasing to your heavenly Father,
conducive to his honour, and be most profitable to yourself; so that in all your getting,
you may get wisdom and understanding in the law of life;
and if I am favoured to keep the foundation,
I shall yet have to rejoice in your prosperity.`"

From a letter written to him by Ann Crowley, dated, Uxbridge, tenth month 29th, 1803,
the following is extracted.

Uxbridge, Tenth month 29th, 1803.

I humbly trust, it is in the renewings of that love,
which unites Christian travellers the world over,
in the precious union of gospel fellowship,
that I feel once more influenced to salute my
endeared friend with an epistolary communication;
not with an apprehension that I possess a mind fraught with goodly treasure,
but from a desire to evince that you are still alive in
the affectionate remembrance of those who have,
in days that are passed, prized the privilege of your instructive society,
and esteemed it a favour when enabled in any degree, to share by sympathy,
the deep exercises permitted, in unfathomable wisdom, to attend you,
while visiting the seed of the kingdom on this side of the Atlantic.

O, my beloved friend, I have often been humbled in spirit,
when favoured with ability to take a retrospective view of the heart-
tendering seasons we have mercifully been favoured together,
when in the liberty of the ever blessed truth we
have communed of things that are excellent,
hid with Christ in God, and only revealed by the renewings of that divine light,
which discovers the deep things that belong to
the eternal well being of the immortal part.
The fresh recollection of seasons,
wherein we were permitted to ascend the holy hill of Zion in company,
and wait together at Wisdom's gate for the renewed unfolding of heavenly counsel,
seems to contrite my spirit,
and enables to subscribe to the truth of that ancient declaration; 'The Lord is good,
and worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance.'
Perhaps I may safely venture to say,
that no seasons have made more profitable impression on my exercised mind,
than those wherein I was made sensible that your faith and patience were deeply tried,
in order to prepare for fresh service in the great Master's house.
I have said in my heart, it is good to be afflicted; for whom the Lord loves he chastens,
and teaches them by his fiery baptisms,
to place all confidence on his Arm of Omnipotency in the day of battle:
and as these are concerned to keep the word of his patience,
endeavouring to possess their minds in humble quiet, they can feelingly say with Job;
'He knows the way that I take, and when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold.'
Ah! my beloved friend, may not a similar language to what was formerly expressed,
be still uttered in the camp of God's Israel; 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but the Lord delivers out of them all.'
In the little ability which has been graciously afforded
mentally to visit your deeply exercised spirit,
it livingly arose in my heart; 'Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver,
I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction;' by trying
dispensations has the Lord purified and sanctified the vessel,
enabling it to show forth his praise; therefore, fear not dearly beloved friend,
though you may still have, at seasons, to pass through the valley of the shadow of death,
and know a being baptised into deep suffering for the seed's sake,
for all these trials will ultimately work together,
to the deepening in the immortal root of life,
and qualifying for further usefulness in the
dignified service you are undoubtedly called to.
There are living witnesses who can acknowledge,
with a sense of gratitude to the efficacy of that power which
prepared you an instrument of great use in this land;
not only by diffusing the truths of the everlasting gospel of light and salvation,
in the demonstration of the eternal Spirit, but by a circumspect conduct,
regulated by unmixed wisdom.
What preaching can more effectually set forth the excellency of saving grace,
or exalt its virtue, than a humble, patient, self-denying life?
Such preachers of righteousness, of which number, I verily believe you may be ranked,
evince to carnal professors,
that there is a God who still rules in the hearts of the children of men,
and if yielded to, effects the great and glorious work of sanctification.
Without premeditation have I scribbled the above,
which I hope will be received with the same cordiality
as you heretofore accepted my free conversation.

Your last kind testimonial of continued affectionate remembrance, came to hand,
as your letters have ever done, in a very acceptable season,
and tended much to my encouragement in giving up to a
weighty service I had long believed required of me,
even to pay a religious visit to all the meetings that
constitute London quarterly meeting;
a work you wilt readily conclude,
arduous enough for a poor little strippling to encounter, amongst the wise and great.
But thanks be ascribed to Him,
who is still manifesting himself to be strength in weakness, riches in poverty,
and a present helper in every time of trial, for his unspeakable mercy,
in that he enabled secretly to utter the language, 'Return unto your rest, O my soul;
for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.'

I had a kind, sympathizing companion in dear D. Moline,
through that momentous undertaking,
and I humbly hope this fresh act of dedication was accepted by the divine Master,
as it has tended a little to break her bonds,
and to the acceptable enlargement of her gift.
O how repugnant to human nature to become a fool for Christ's and the gospel's sake!
May the Lord so operate by his redeeming, purifying hand,
as to enable each of us in our several capacities to say in all things, 'Not my will,
but yours be done, O you ever adorable Master.'
I have lately been spending a few weeks with my relations at Shillingford, Reading,
and Staines; and though this visit was professedly in the line of friendship,
yet a large portion of secret exercise, and some public labour fell to my lot.
It has been a time of trial, both of faith and patience,
in which I have found the necessity to renew my covenant with a covenant keeping God:
there is much cause administered in the present
day of great degeneracy from the purity of truth,
for lamentation and mourning;
and may the God of all grace enable his devoted
servants to stand fast in their allotments,
patiently filling up their measure of suffering for the precious seed's sake.
I believe you wilt be truly glad to hear, that our mutually beloved friend T. H.,
continues growing in the root of life,
and has publicly avowed his allegiance to the King immortal.
He is as a father amongst the few poor scattered sheep hereaway.
O that wisdom and strength may still be granted,
to enable him to keep his rank in righteousness.`"

The following are to Susanna Horne:

Thomas Scattergood to Susanna Horne

Philadelphia, Filth month 9th, 1804.

Dear friend,

You may rest assured, that since the arrival of your last, and also before that,
you have been often the companion of my mind, and under the sense also,
that it follows you in all your exercises and religious movements,
with desires you may be preserved on that foundation that stands sure,
faithfully following your heavenly Guide, to the finishing of all the work allotted you;
and that we may be happy enjoyers of that rest,
which is prepared for such as hold out unto the end.
I feel for my part, like a vessel much laid by: great,
you know was the travail and exercise I had to wade through when amongst you,
and great was your sympathy and care towards me.
None perhaps have beheld me in greater weakness, fear and trembling than you.
I cannot forget the wormwood and the gall,
and yet feel disposed to believe I could not have done without it;
and have a humble hope, that all my misgivings and lack of faith and firmness,
in seasons of deepest trial and seeming desertion, will be blotted out of the book.
My little labours seem much confined to this place,
having very little openness to go from home,
and I esteem it a favour to have so comfortable a one They +++[+++his partners in business]
have agreed to take the labouring oar, and set me at liberty, much to my satisfaction;
and I hope the disposition of an old soldier who has been in many a warfare,
measurably prevails, even a willingness to go forth any where, at the word of command;
but may my soul ever be favoured with this, and not attempt to uphold the ark unbidden.

Thomas Scattergood.

In the same year:

"`I feel near regard towards you in penning these lines,
with desires you may continue watchful and faithful to
the filling up of the measure of appointed duty,
that you may grow in grace and saving knowledge,
and then doubtless you wilt grow in the gift committed to your charge.
I think I can say that the desire of my soul has been on my own account,
from my little beginning, that I might be preserved from being a light, windy,
or frothy minister; but be favoured to wait for a commission sealed;
though I know there are times when we must move from very small impressions,
and there needs great care in moving in the dignified work of the gospel.
It is waiting for, and renewedly feeling, the touches of the live coal,
that makes words reach to the captive seed in others.

T+++.+++ Scattergood.

The following letters will doubtless be acceptable to the reader:

Ann Crowley to Thomas Scattergood

Uxbridge, Sixth month 20th, 1804.

Beloved friend,

Having been renewedly favoured this morning,
to feel a revival of that love which reaches over sea and land,
and makes the disciples of Christ dear to each other,
I seem stimulated to embrace the present opportunity of convincing you,
that you are still preciously alive in the remembrance
of your friends on this side the Atlantic,
Perhaps I may, in much sincerity, venture to say,
that your poor friend is one of the number who, according to the capacity received,
feels you near in the blessed covenant of love and life: believing;
you are a chosen vessel of the Most High,
on whom the inscription of holiness unto the Lord, is written in legible characters.
O, says my spirit,
that the blessing of preservation may be mercifully granted through the
remaining rugged steps you may have to tread in this probationary state,
that so, by being enabled to keep the faith,
and fight the good fight under the banner of the Lamb, Christ Jesus,
a crown of ever-enduring peace may be your happy portion,
when the shackles of mortality may be removed,
and death swallowed up in a glorious victory.

It has afforded me much solid satisfaction to hear, through various channels,
that you have been favoured to enjoy a pretty good
share of health since returning to your native land,
and appeared to possess a serenity of mind,
which the reward for obedience does not fail to afford.
I have often had to remember,
how many deep draughts of the wormwood and gall you had to drink
while in our land,--how deeply were faith and patience tried,
yet through all the varied baptisms of the living Word,
the many descendings and fiery trials, which, in wisdom were permitted to overtake you,
you have abundant cause to erect your Ebenezer, and say,
'Hitherto has the Lord helped;' yes, and I am renewed in the belief,
that he will not fail to stretch forth his omnipotent Arm of
power to preserve in every dispensation of his Providence.
Have not many cups of sweet consolation been handed to you in secret,
by Him who still delights to succour his own flock,
and strengthen for every good word and work?
Be of good cheer then, my endeared friend, for verily, according to the promise,
He that has been the Alpha, will most assuredly be the Omega,
if we faithfully continue to manifest our allegiance to Him, who is King of kings,
by a circumspect walking in his lear.

Although I have not been favoured to receive any written testimonial
of your continued affectionate regard since my last communication,
yet I am ready to indulge a hope I am not wholly
forgotten by my much beloved exercised brother,
but that his solicitude for my preservation is unabated;
and though conscious of not meriting this privilege,
I dare not doubt possessing it in some degree,
believing our friendship to be founded on a basis too
permanent for the fluctuating things of time to shake,
or the changes of dispensation to weaken.
No, surely; I fully believe, as our abiding continues to be in the living vine,
and we are favoured, through adorable mercy,
to increase in the saving knowledge of redeeming love,
our hearts will be more closely bound together in the cementing virtue of gospel union,
and secret intercession will be made with the God of all grace,
that his all-powerful Arm of salvation may be vouchsafed, to keep in a humble dependence,
both in heights and in depths,
that no gilded bait or destroying weapon prepared by the cruel adversary,
may ever be able to exalt above measure,
or sink the poor tossed mind below a holy
confidence in Him who never was foiled in battle,
and remains to be the ever victorious Captain of the soul's salvation.

I seem to be furnished with very little consoling, comforting information;
having more often to sit down and lament over my own weaknesses and failings,
with those which are obvious amongst a highly professing people,
than to rejoice in the prosperity of Zion,
and joy in beholding the enlargement of her borders.
Yet I humbly trust, though things of a trying nature may be in our camp,
and the pure life of religion at a very low ebb, there are many preserved alive unto God,
who have not dared to bow the knee to Baal, or kiss his image;
but who are faithfully bound to the law and the testimonies,
counting not their lives dearer to them than the
blessed cause of truth and righteousness.
It seems to be a time of deep wading with such exercised minds,
because the beauty of Israel is much eclipsed,
and too few of her professed children are coming up to
the solemn feasts of the Lord with holy dignity.
Oh! when will an individual reformation take place,
that 'judgment may run down as waters,
and righteousness as a mighty stream;' that the kingdoms of
this world may indeed become the Lord's and his Christ's.

Ann Crowley.

John Taber to Thomas Scattergood

Portland, Eighth month 9th, 1804.

Dear friend,

As our friend Daniel Elliot is about leaving this place,
I feel as though I could not miss the opportunity of reviving the love and nearness,
I think we have in past times felt toward each other; and at this time,
as at many others,
you are brought very near to me in a belief that many and great have been your conflicts,
as well as mine, since we saw each other.
I may say, mine have often been so great,
that it has appeared there was but a step between me and spiritual death,
and that I should surely fall one day or other by the hand of Saul;
and I have my fears that it will yet be my case,
for lack of being sufficiently reduced to a willingness
to suffer with patience and resignation,
whatever may be my lot.
I have often thought of you in my greatest conflicts,
believing you are no stranger to deep baptisms,
but doubtless yours may be more on others account, and mine on my own;
but be that as it may,
I think the enemy of all good often takes the advantage at such times,
to cast out floods of discouragement, in order if possible, to swallow us up;
and sink we should, did not our blessed Master take compassion on us,
and reach out his hand, as he did to Peter, when his faith failed him,
and he was about to sink.

So that we have abundant cause to take courage and press forward, remembering,
as our day of trial is, so shall our strength be.
I write not to you with a view of instructing, but from a near fellow feeling with you,
which I think my mind has been dipped into this morning,
and I crave your prayers that my faith fail not; for it is often at a very low ebb,
and many fears encompass my feeble mind.
With near love to you and your dear wife, with which mine unites,
I remain your affectionate friend,

John Taber.

The following letter from his friend David Brooks, is dated

Eighth month 15th, 1804.

I have not forgotten you nor your kindness to me when my lot was cast in your city:
there is One only who knows what I passed through there, I may say in a two fold sense;
but I hope, and have some cause to believe that I was not altogether without companions.
I do not wish to complain or murmur,
for our afflictions are but light when compared to the sufferings of our blessed Saviour,
whose agony was so great that sweat, as it were,
great drops of blood rolled from his sacred face.

Dear friends, I often think of you with great sweetness,
and I feel an assurance that you are going on your way mourning,
as with your hands on your loins, and passing through dark and lonesome places;
but we may remember, there is no beast of prey to devour in the Lord's highway,
I sometimes have faith to believe, that the Lord's candle will be again lighted,
and hope we shall be enabled to wait patiently all his appointed time,
for he I that believes makes not haste; and he that runs when he is not sent,
will not be likely to profit the people.
A superficial ministry has a powerful tendency to close up and stop the sweet,
living spring of true gospel ministry.
It is a great lesson to learn to bear trials properly as they arise,
and I am sometimes afraid of myself,
I can bear so little with the Christian fortitude which becomes a soldier of the Lamb.
Dear friends, the distance of the way and the length of time,
only serve to strengthen the bond of that love
which stands in the power of an endless life,
in which I nearly salute you, and bid you farewell.`"

The following is taken from a letter written by him to Susanna Horne:

Philadelphia, Fifth month 24th, 1805.

There is a secret rejoicing accompanying my mind,
in hearing of your industry to get forward in your day's work.
It is a pleasant thing to look back and remember the
willingness wrought in the mind to labour in the morning.
I feel it so, as one to whom the afternoon has come; there seems little to open with me,
except now and then to a quarterly meeting, but much at home.
Go on in fear and trembling still,--expect to meet with your various trials; wait,
I beseech you,
as one desirous you may be numbered amongst the true born
children--wait for the renewed touches of the live coal;
wait for the seal and evidence: this will make your language drop as dew,
to the consolation of the mourners and tried burden bearers,
and you wilt grow in your gift;
sound judgment will be experienced also to know what is sealed or seasoned,
where to deliver or scatter it, and also the time when; so living without carefulness,
in due time the Lord gives a right issue.`"

The following is extracted from a letter from his friend John Bevans, dated,

Plaistow, 1st of Second month, 1805.

Dear friend,

It would have been very pleasant to me to have written to you before now,
but feeling my mind often clothed with much deep poverty,
it seemed as though I could not, either profitably to myself or to others,
take up the pen.
But from some little renewal of that brotherly love which unites the
Lord's children in that life which is better felt than expressed,
I can at this time salute you my beloved friend.
Trying times have been the portion of many brethren on
this side the water since you left us.
You and others have had your perils by land and perils by water,
but ours have been by false brethren, who,
by fair speeches and great pretensions to liberality,
have deceived and misled some in many places.
But I hope the firmness of Friends pretty generally on this side the water and on yours,
will in good measure put a stop to this delusive spirit.
These things have brought to my mind the deep
exercises you were often under while amongst us,
and particularly in our great city.
I believe there was a cause, which was not then altogether manifest,
but has since burst upon us as a gathered cloud; and I fear not a few,
more particularly among our wise men, are carried away with it.
At the same time, it is no small consolation,
that there are amongst us many faithful brethren,
and it is to be hoped that others have been stirred up to try their foundations;
and to such we may hope it will ultimately prove profitable.

"`I had written the above a considerable time since,
but feeling again too much discouragement from a variety of causes, I could not proceed.
Your last letter was very acceptable,
and the recollection that I had not acknowledged the former, has been painful to me;
yet it is not for lack of an affectionate remembrance,
but writing is become more a task to me, and living in this retired spot,
I see and hear much less of our friends than we were accustomed to do.
William Jackson paid our meeting an acceptable visit a short time since;
Ann Crowley has also been with us in the same way.
Thomas Colley has been much engaged amongst those not of our Society for sometime;
he was lately at Birmingham, where he had several public meetings,
to much satisfaction some of those meetings were held at
dissenting meeting-houses in different parts of the town,
for their accommodation.
Perhaps you may know that some of the disaffected among us have been very active,
and have published several pieces,
greatly misrepresenting the conduct of Society in the case of Hannah Barnard;
and also by mutilating the writings of our ancient Friends,
have made them to speak a language they neither intended nor thought of.
They have likewise endeavoured to invalidate several
parts of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.
The above publications have much tendency to
turn the feet of the unwary out of the right way,
making the offence of the cross to cease,
and the path wide enough for the old corrupt man to walk safely in,
without danger of alarm, it being in their view,
sufficient to preserve a fair moral conduct before men,
without being shackled with the mistaken notions of a new birth from above,
and the necessity 'of an inward and vital change, which the humble,
self-denying Christian considers essential to his eternal well being.
They tell us our reason is the primary gift of God, and able to guide us safely along,
in all that is necessary to salvation,
rejecting the sacrifice and atonement of Christ as absurd.
Thus deluded and deceived, they attempt to mislead and deceive others,
and it is to be feared that too many are readily caught in the snare.

The account you have given of yourself since your return to your own quiet habitation,
has been very pleasant to us;
and that you have had to enjoy domestic comforts after much exercise, toil and labour.
The language of the prophet occurring, I shall insert it:
'The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness,
quietness and assurance forever.
And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings,
and in quiet resting places.'
The application I leave to my dear friend;
I believe this you can do from heartfelt experience.

John Bevans.

From an apprehension of religious duty,
he spent the summers of 1805 and 1806 at West-town boarding school,
sometimes assisting in teaching, as well as in the care of the pupils.
He was very fond of the society of children,
and deeply interested in their eternal welfare: he freely mingled with the pupils,
and participated frequently in their amusements,
which gained their confidence and affectionate regard,
and enabled him to exercise an important and valuable influence upon them.
His religious counsel was also very strengthening and
encouraging to the teachers and others,
who found in him a true sympathizer in the arduous duties of their important stations.

A Friend who resided at the Institution at that period, speaking of his services there,
remarks, that "`he was concerned to enter closely into the care, the exercises,
and trials under which the caretakers were then wading;
and very useful and beneficial were his labours,
not only in their schools and private collections, from which he was seldom missing,
but in their religious meetings also; as many of those there in that day can testify,
to their great comfort.
From my distinct remembrance of his gospel labours, I then believed they were owned,
and now at this day can say,
I believe they have been crowned with success in many instances.
He was greatly favoured and enlarged in testimony in their religious meetings,
many times to the tendering and contriting of the minds
of those present who were of susceptible feelings;
and often was favoured in supplication with near access to the throne of grace,
to the comfort and bowing of every contrite soul.
Ah! these opportunities cannot be forgotten.`"

His interest in the institution continued to the time of his decease.
After returning from there, the last time in 1806,
he addressed a letter to the teachers through one of their number,
from which the following extracts are taken:

"`The plan you sent me met my approbation,
and immediately my thoughts were turned toward all the thoughtfully exercised teachers;
and I said in my heart, go on precious servants as you have begun,
and doubtless you will prosper.
Your station and work is honourable, and no doubt remains on my mind,
but that you are watched over and cared for by the great Shepherd of Israel, who said,
'feed my sheep.'
This is your employ; let your hands be strong in the work,
and resist all those discouragements, both within and without, which at times,
very likely, assail you.
I am not a stranger to your exercises, having been sensibly dipped with you.
Yes, you will believe me when I say my mind was exercised, feelingly so,
and plunged into most or all your trials, when with you,
and how preciously comfortable was the little fragment of my pilgrimage there filled up.
Many comfortable moments I enjoyed;
many pleasant prospects were opened respecting the rising of the church out of Babylon;
and I have, since that day, said in my heart,
O that there were many schools erected for children's guarded education.
As I have told you, your work is honourable, so I believe a precious reward awaits,
for giving up the prime of your days to perform it.
It is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord, even sometimes of a sudden,
to enrich for little acts of faith, and labours of love.
I frequently look at you with sweetness, and send this little messenger,
desiring it may prove, in some degree, an encouragement to you all,
on both sides of the house, to continue in the way of your known duty, continuing to be,
according to present ability,--your affectionate and sympathizing friend,

Thomas Scattergood.

First month 6th, 1806.

From his labours at West-town, and the above letter,
it will be seen that he felt a lively concern for the religious,
guarded education of the youth of our Society,
being fully aware of the important influence such a course of
instruction would exercise upon them in after life.
His interest in schools, and the course of education, was not, however,
confined to any particular class.
He felt for all descriptions of his fellow men,
and was ready to promote their welfare in every right way.
He was especially qualified to feel for and sympathize with the poor,
among whom he was a very frequent visitor,
whose needs he was enabled largely to relieve by the assistance of his friends,
who frequently sent him sums of money to be appropriated for this purpose,
at his discretion.
His visits among the poor,
afforded him a good opportunity of observing the idle
habits and neglected education of their children,
which he saw led them into many immoral practices.
Being much impressed with the demoralizing
influences attending the situation of this class,
he communicated his feelings to a number of Friends,
and proposed to them to unite in an effort to establish a school for such,
on the Lancasterian system, which was then just claiming attention.
Having succeeded in interesting several in such an undertaking,
a meeting of Friends was called, in the ninth month, 1807,
to consider the propriety of forming an association to carry out their benevolent object.
The plan was cordially approved,
and in the next month the association was duly organised,
and was subsequently chartered by the Supreme court,
under the name of "`The Association of Friends for the instruction of poor children.`"
It was found necessary, in a short time,
to build a house for the purpose of accommodating the
large number of children who applied for admission.
Thomas Scattergood and another Friend gave the association a lot for this purpose,
and early in 1809 a building was erected,
in which the school was continued for nine years,
affording the blessing of moral and literary instruction to many destitute children.
In 1818, the education of the poor being adequately provided for by law,
the school was discontinued,
and the funds of the association allowed to accumulate for four years,
when they were appropriated for the instruction of poor coloured children,
for which object they continue to be very usefully applied.

The following are extracts from letters, addressed by him to his friend Susanna Horne:

"`1806.--I have done but little at writing of late, and feel but small ability,
nevertheless my thoughts often waft over to you,
and I still feel interested in your welfare,
though much as one on whom the ends of the world is come.
This you knows was much the case once, and what marvel, when it has been,
and very likely must be, the experience again of many in your land.
Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins?
etc.; this is the portion of Zion that dwells in the midst of Babylon;
and when the dispensation is yet more fully known,
there will be a rising and shaking of the dry bones.
I am glad you remain desirous to be one of her exercised travailers; go on and prosper,
and fulfil your task, while strength of body and mind is vouchsafed;
and you wilt never have cause to repent your enlistment into such a work.`"

Sixth month 9th, 1809.

Extract,--"`Leaving the things that are behind, let us press forward:
O that the blessed Master may account us worthy to be
employed in his work during our few remaining days.
As for you, you seems to be going from one little service and journey to another, much,
I think, as I was when about your age, I seem, at least sometimes,
like a vessel laid up in dock.
Perhaps this may be more your state bye and bye,
and if you are upright and honest in the present season, it will be no matter then.
Though the body has been much stationary, yet my mind is often far off from it.
My exercise was not small when among you, in often mentally visiting the continent,
and beholding the distress began and coming more upon nations and kingdoms;
and I am still often abroad in mind.
Surely, I have said in my heart, the Lord has arisen,
and is shaking the foundations of the earth: this,
I think was more like a promise than otherwise,
that the heavens and earth should be shaken,
that so that which could not be shaken might remain;
but how little is this seen into by many.
May we, dear friend, be washed from every defilement, both of flesh and spirit;
and press after holiness--press after a settled stable mind,
in which the divine will is given up to, is the desire of your friend,
on his own account, and also on account of you, whose welfare is very near to him,
and who yet remains your affectionate friend,

Thomas Scattergood.

In the fourth month, 1811,
he obtained the necessary certificates of unity with his prospect to pay a
religious visit to the yearly meetings of New York and Rhode Island,
and some of the meetings composing them.

In this journey he accompanied his beloved friend Susanna Horne, from England,
who was then engaged in a religious visit to this country.
The first memorandum of this visit commences at Lynn, and is as follows:

"`Seventh month 21st, first-day.--Attended two meetings at Lynn; on the 23rd,
a meeting at Salem, which was a comfortable time;
and on the 25th had a meeting in the large Methodist house at Boston, at four o'clock,
which was satisfactory.

"`28th, first-day.--Went to Salem meeting, where I was silent,
and it was a very low time with me.
The afternoon meeting was largely attended by people of other societies,
and I was favoured with enlargement toward them.

"`29th.--To Amesbury, to old Jacob Rowell's; he is in his eighty-eighth,
and his wife in her eightieth year.
Stopped and dined at Newburyport, and as soon as I was out of the chaise,
I turned involuntarily down the street to view the ruins made by a late fire.
It appears to have consumed even to the water's edge,
and some of the wharves did not escape, about two hundred and fifty houses were burned.
We sent for some of the inhabitants; eight or ten of whom came,
and we proposed a meeting for tomorrow afternoon, to which they readily consented,
and the court house was procured.

"`30th.--Amesbury meeting was small and a poor low time;
after which proceeded to Newburyport, and had a very crowded meeting,
which was satisfactory--we were taken home by Ebenezer Wheelwright to tea,
where a number of the neighbours came in, and it was an agreeable time.

"`31st.--To meeting at Seabrook: it was a remarkably warm day, and the labour fell on me.
Susanna Horne was so overcome with the heat as to take to her bed for a time,
but afterwards she took courage and rode in the afternoon eighteen miles, to B. Folsom's,
at Epping.

"`Eighth month 1st.--To meeting at Epping, where several of the neighbours came in,
though it was a rainy morning, and it proved a pretty open time.
After dinner set off accompanied by Eli Beede,
and lodged at an inn about fifteen miles distant, where we met with poor accommodations,
but the kindness manifested made it easy.

"`2nd.--Rode to Henniker, over a rough road, eighteen miles,
and lodged at Pelatiah Purington's, which was a comfortable resting place.
Had a satisfactory meeting, and a good opportunity in the family.

"`4th, first-day.--To the meeting held in the north house at Weare; dined at W. D.'s,
and before we set off had a tendering opportunity,
in which the old man was much affected.
At four o'clock went to meeting in the south house,
about three miles off--both of these meetings were laborious and pretty large.

"`5th.--After a pretty early breakfast, and a good opportunity with this large,
and in good degree, well conducted family,
where there are hopeful children and careful parents, accompanied by David Gove,
we rode back to Concord.
Stopped at R. B.'s, whose husband is not a member; she has seven miles to go to meeting:
here we had a little opportunity, which I hope was to some profit.
Dined at Abel Houghton's, and at four o'clock went to a meeting in the court house:
there were about twelve or fifteen members, all women and children except two;
Susanna had a pretty relieving, good time.
I felt like a sign to be gazed and wondered at.
We detained the little company of members after the others were gone,
and had a comfortable opportunity with them.

"`6th.--Went to Pittsfield, and it was a pensive time to me,
and nothing to do in the meeting; being covered with a cloud of exercise,
and exceedingly empty and poor: I thought Susanna had a pretty open time.
After dinner rode to Gilmantown--put up at E. Hoyts's. This
Friend and his wife came into Society about sixteen years ago,
and since there has been a gathering to them of others convinced,
and some Friends who moved from other places.
When we were within a few miles of this place,
our guide proposed beginning to invite to a meeting to be held tomorrow,
but I felt an entire stop in my mind,
and on mentioning it to Susanna we freely agreed to go on to a Friend's house,
and wait there to see what would be best.

"`7th.--My mind was much exercised after getting up,
and I walked out pensively before breakfast,
and when we sat down to eat was engaged in supplication for our little band,
and all left behind--for this family, and for the enlargement of Zion's borders;
and felt more easy after it.
Yesterday afternoon I thought we were going to a Friend's
house which would be a resting place,--and so it proves,
and we need it.
After breakfast took a lonely walk,
and enjoyed the beautiful and extensive prospect which it afforded.
Sat down in inward retirement afterwards,
when the situation of some of the Lord's exercised prophets came into remembrance;
such as Elijah and others, who wandered about in desolate places;
as also the temptation of the greatest of all, even the Lord Jesus himself,
in the wilderness;
and I strove in his name to offer up a petition for the blessing of preservation,
through and over these besetments, which so cleave to me in this my pilgrimage state.

"`8th.--To a pretty large meeting, made up of the few Friends hereaway, and others.
It was laborious, and the service fell pretty much on me: we stopped Friends afterward,
and Susanna was favoured measurably to get relief.

"`9th.--Accompanied by our friend E. Hoyt, we rode to Sandwich, about thirty-one miles,
to Cyrus Beede's. It was a delightful hilly country, and a good road.

"`10th.--To a meeting about seven miles further,
held at Solomon Hoyt's. This was a time of favour and encouragement:
dined at John Folsom's,
and afterwards had a very satisfactory opportunity with the family.

"`11th, first-day.--After breakfast Benjamin Scribner came in;
he was much broken on meeting with me, and continued in this tender condition sometime.
Cyrus Beede related to me the following circumstance: when I was here before,
a man who lived at some distance, came into the meeting,
which was then held at Benjamin Scribner's, and endeavoured to get his brother,
Aaron Beede, to follow him out;
but upon every attempt Aaron motioned for him to sit down,
and at last prevailed on him so to do, and he staid the meeting out.
In the course of the communication,
mention was made of the grievousness of the sin of injuring our neighbours,
and that such as did so, would be met with sooner or later.
This man, after getting home, which was immediately after meeting,
went to one of his neighbours, and told him that he had injured one of his oxen,
and hid him in the woods, and offered to make him restitution for the same.
It was not known what he wanted with Aaron Beede when he came to get him out of meeting.
The house at Sandwich could not contain the people who came to meeting.
This proved a tendering time; and we were both pretty largely engaged therein.
After meeting, Samuel, son of Benjamin Scribner,
was introduced to me as I came out the door;
his eyes overflowed on my saying a few words to him.
I was also introduced to several after meeting,
who remembered me when I was here twenty-seven years ago.

"`On being informed that the people who met in a large house not far distant,
would not come to our meeting,
some Friends went and proposed for them to consider
whether they would come in the afternoon to our meeting,
if they thought there would be room,
or give me an opportunity with them in their own house:
they thought the latter would be best, namely: for us to come to their house.
We went, and I got relief thereby;
my friend Susanna Horne did not feel much of this concern, yet bore me company.

"`12th.--Set off about eight o'clock, accompanied by Nathan Beede to Wolfborough,
and got to Joseph Varney's. Paul Bunker met us here;
he went on yesterday afternoon and appointed a meeting in this house at three o'clock.
In this meeting Susanna had all the labour:
we stopped the little company of Friends afterwards, and it was a tendering time,
as also next morning with this family, on parting.

"`14th.--Reached the monthly meeting at Middleburg, and then to Rochester and lodged.

"`15th.--To select monthly meeting at Berwick, fifteen miles.
This was a small meeting, but a time of some comfort and encouragement.

"`16th.--Very low and under discouragement this morning.
Trust in God, O my soul; I hope yet to praise him.
We attended the monthly meeting in this place, and found things low,
Joseph Savage spoke to me after meeting;
he was a captain in the artillery in the time of the war, and quartered at Burlington:
he appears measurably convinced of Friends' principles.

"`17th.--To William Brown's near Dover, and on the 18th, first-day,
attended their meeting.
It was very large, though no liberty was given to invite the neighbours.
We learn that there is much division and unsettlement in this place;
no priest among them at present, and therefore no meeting.
It proved a pretty open time,
and this large assembly was recommended to the Lord Jesus Christ,
the everlasting Teacher and High Priest.
This has been a day of exercise to me on various accounts, but I trust profitable.

"`19th.--Staid at William Brown's until about eleven o'clock,
and then I rode with him to Rochester.

"`20th.--Had a favoured meeting, appointed at this place,
and in the afternoon went on toward Berwick again.
I lay down in sorrow, in consequence of not keeping the girdle of truth girt close enough.
Ah! what a little deviation affects a mind that is tender.
The cutting off but a small piece of Saul's garment by David, when he was in his power,
made his heart smite him, and so has mine, and I begged pardon almost immediately,
and yet I feared I should be set aside for a time for this.
O my God and Saviour!
I have covenanted to serve you all my days--preserve my feet from falling.

"`21st.--Meeting of ministers and elders,
and to my admiration I was exercised in it in the line of ministry.
Ah! here was no room for exaltation, neither on looking into myself, nor over the flock;
there is yet bitterness in my cup this evening.

"`22nd.--To a large congregation of Friends and others, assembled at quarterly meeting,
and we were pretty largely engaged therein;
it appeared to be a solid time for the most part.
We sat from eleven to near five o'clock,
and at the close of this great day's labour I felt comfortable and thankful.

"`24th.--To Windham monthly meeting; where we had a good time in the first meeting.

"`25th, first-day,--To Falmouth, and I was shut up in silent exercise:
Susanna relieved her mind, and I was glad of it.
After meeting stopped at Stephen Monall's, and visited his sick wife in her chamber.
When I was in this land before, I had a remarkable opening at two different times,
as I sat in this meetinghouse.
One was to go directly back to Boston,
and then take such meetings as David Sands and I had left on our way here,
and also the monthly meetings, and amongst the places was Sandwich, then a wilderness;
all which was accomplished to my great peace and comfort,
for I got through the prospect that opened, and returned to Falmouth in one month,
and attended the quarterly meeting.
While sitting in that, I had an opening of the way home very clearly, even to a day,
and my soul, with thankfulness, remembers the favour while penning this note.
Now I am shut up--there are great changes in twenty-seven years,
and no virtue in meeting-houses, I find.
Dined at John Winslow's, and he and wife went with us to Portland,
to an afternoon meeting, where was a mixed company, and very unsettled.
Susanna had but an exercising time, and I was quite shut up.

"`26th.--We got into Joseph Douglass' at Durham, before night.

"`27th.--After an opportunity with two widows and their children,
attended the meeting at Durham, which was large, and an open time.

"`28th.--To Amos Davis', and put up before meeting, which was held in a school house,
an awkward place: Susanna Horne had all the labour.
I felt for her, and for this very little company of Friends,
but there was no food in my barn, nor wine in my press.
Proceeded on our journey and lodged at Joseph Samson's. This Friend, it appears,
was a soldier in the revolution, and settled here twenty-seven years ago.
The two first years he came and cut down a few trees, burnt the brush and upper limbs,
and planted a little corn without the use of plough or harrow,
for he had neither ox nor horse for some time: he then brought his wife,
after raising a small habitation for her,
and had to carry a bushel of corn eight or ten miles to mill on his shoulder,
and for seven years had not above one dollar in possession;
now he has a pretty large habitation.

"`29th.--To meeting at Leeds, and put up our horses near the meeting-house, at J. W.'s,
on a remarkably high hill, from which there is an extensive prospect.
This was a good time, and after the meeting went back to J. W.'s and dined;
with this family and some others we had a satisfactory opportunity before we parted.

"`30th.--This morning we paid a visit to two ancient Baptists,
living in a small adjoining house, and after I had delivered what was on my mind,
the old man preached us a little sermon.
The meeting was a good one, although small.
After dinner and a comfortable opportunity with the large family where we dined,
we took our departure again, and rode fourteen miles.
About half this distance we ascended a high hill, from the top of which Augusta,
on the Kennebeck river, opened to our view,
with the land on the other side--a very delightful prospect indeed;
nothing have I seen in this journey, that came nearer, in my view,
than this to some of the beautiful spots in England.
We got to our friend S. W.'s, at Sidney, about dark, and met a kind reception.

"`31st.--To meeting, which was held in a comfortable house, and proved an open,
good time; we stopped in at the nearest house and had a tendering time with D. P.,
wife and children, and after dinner proceeded to Belgrave.

"`Ninth month 1st, first-day.--In the morning returned to W. D.'s before meeting time;
this industrious,
goodly Friend fitted up his house with benches to pretty good advantage,
and we were favoured in a large meeting:
a motherly old woman came to me after it broke up, and inquired after David Sands,
saying, with the tears running down as she spoke,
'Ah! he was the first that offered up public prayer for us in this remote country.'
After dinner we proceeded to Fairfield, about twelve or fourteen miles.
This seemed to be the roughest ride we have experienced.
In one or two instances our guide endeavoured to hold
up our carriages to prevent them from overturning.

"`2nd.--To meeting in a comfortable meeting-house,
which I conclude has been the most enlarged
meeting we have had since we have been together.
Marvellous it was to me, to think of being here,
when I looked back and remembered being at Vassalborough years ago,
when nothing but trees and rocks were to be seen in these parts,
and now a large and open meeting.
We had some satisfactory conversation with a serious professor who requested it.

"`3rd.--Set off about eight o'clock this morning, after a religious opportunity,
and rode about nineteen miles to Moses Sleeper's, at Vassalborough,
about two miles beyond the meeting-house.
This Friend was a soldier in the American war, and being convinced,
came amongst Friends a little before David Sands and I visited this neighbourhood.
I remember well the visit David and I paid him and wife, then lately married;
he had cleared about half an acre of land and built a small log house.

"`4th.--To select meeting--it was not large, but ended, I thought,
profitably and comfortable.
I took Susanna Horne and Mary Allinson in our chaise to it, about two miles.
On our way home, when within about half a mile of Moses Sleeper's,
the horse suddenly took fright,
and we appeared to have a very narrow escape from broken limbs, or death itself;
thanks be rendered where due.

"`5th.--To quarterly meeting, which was large;
and I thought Susanna Horne was much favoured:
the business was conducted with condescension,
and on the whole it was a satisfactory time;
we had the company of various Friends in the evening, and a religious opportunity.

"`6th.--To Haarlem meeting, on the far side of the Pond, twelve miles distant,
accompanied by Moses Sleeper; the house is not quite finished,
but pretty well fitted with benches, and we were favoured with a large meeting,
to my surprise.
I thought many goodly ones, both Friends and others, were there:
the labour of this day has fallen on me, and it was a memorable day to me,
both before and in the meeting.
We went in the afternoon to Moses Dow's and lodged, near the Pond meeting-house,
about five miles from Moses Sleeper's.

"`7th.--To the Pond meeting, which was large.
Susanna Horne spoke first, and had a favoured time,
and indeed it was a remarkable meeting;
there were two appearances from professors--the first short and the other long,
but we thought best to bear with them, and hope the meeting ended well.
We put up in a little village; and I am in admiration at the increase of the country.

"`8th.--Went to Kennebeck meeting, which proved a sweet parting time;
Susanna Horne opened it in supplication, which I felt not only on the way to meeting,
but soon after sitting down, and therefore could feelingly unite in it,
and trust encouragement and strength were administered
to us by the great and good Shepherd of Israel.
We rode in the afternoon seventeen miles, to George Randall's,
and called by the way see a man, by the name of Gitty,
who told me that he is one hundred and twenty-two years old.

"`9th.--Attended an appointed meeting in an unfinished Methodist meeting-house.
It was the day of general muster,
and but few came besides George Randall's family and one more,
but it proved a very solemn,
sweet opportunity--the service lay with Susanna Horne pretty much, and I felt content.
Low and poor this afternoon,
anxiously concerned rightly to see my way in further movements.

"`10th.--To Samuel Tobey's, at Bristol, about thirty-three miles:
part of the ride today was through a wilderness,
but in other parts there were remarkably good houses.
We stopped at Nobleborough and dined: here we met with uncommon accommodations;
the house being a very neat one, and the furniture in accordance with it.

"`11th.--To meeting about two miles distant: the house is opposite to Broad Cove.
The company was not large, and Susanna Horne had all the labour.
I was very poor.

"`12th.--Set off early, passed through Nobleborough and dined at Wiscassett, a seaport,
which appears to be a thriving place.
We lodged at village called Brunswick; this appears to be another thriving place,
and but lately cut out of the woods; they have already a pretty large college,
a president's house and chapel, on a very beautiful level.

"`13th.--Got a pretty early breakfast and proceeded to Portland;
found some difficulty when we came to North Yarmouth bridge,
and had to be ferried over the river.

"`14th.--A night of conflict when awake; I seem broken up as to moving on,
and O how I am veiled--I cannot go forth out of prison.
I have been thinking of the prophet's expressions, or the apostle quoting him,
respecting our blessed Lord and Saviour: 'In his humiliation his judgment was taken away,
and who can declare his generation; for his life was taken from the earth.'
O that I might hold the mystery of faith in a more pure conscience;
then may my soul hope for deeper and more lasting
instruction by what is permitted to befal me.

"`15th, first-day.--Very close searching of heart upon my bed this morning,
and feel a little more peaceful and quiet:
what need of patience and resignation to wait the Lord's time, which cannot be hastened.
I passed through both the meetings in silent conflict, and Susanna Horne also.

"`16th,
second-day.--Susanna Horne has her mind turned toward a little company on
the Cape opposite this place +++[+++Portland]. I am very blind and cannot help it.

"`17th.--Resigned, I trust this morning, into the arms of Christ,
for protection and further help, who can anoint mine eye to see how to move,
and what to do.
Lord, I would most willingly resign my state, present and future, to your disposal.
I have been greatly distressed in this place.
I hear that there is great profession of religion,
and a great variety in this little town; but ah! the living, eternal Truth is but one:
the Lord, he is one, and his name one; bow then, unto him, O my soul,
and serve him the remainder of your days here on earth.
Before we set off to attend the meeting, held at Nathaniel Dyer's, on Cape Elizabeth,
we sat down with S. H. and family, and by this means my mind was greatly relieved,
and we parted in much brokenness and tenderness on the part of some.
Left my companion to see after mending the chaise, and R. Horton took me in his.
This has been an encouraging meeting,
and I have a hope there will be an increase hereaway.
We called by the way at W. F.'s, who lately came into Society.
His aged parents live with him, and this dear old man was tendered, both in meeting,
and now in a sitting with the family; the case of good old Simeon being treated on:
he appears to love Friends and their company.
Parted tenderly from the family and reached Calvin Stuart's before night.
A great change in my feelings, but feel the effects of so deep a plunge;
surely I may say with David,
'My heart and my flesh also fainted in the hour of conflict.'

"`18th.--Susanna Horne had all the public labour in the meeting held today.
Soon after it broke my companion arrived, accompanied by Edward Cobb,
who continued with us to Kennebeck,

"`19th, fifth-day.--To Paul Rogers' at Berwick, where we had a meeting,
made up chiefly of Friends.
Dear Susanna had an open, enlarged time.
It was a season of light, comfort and encouragement to me:
I remembered the remarkable tendering time we had in this house when with David Sands;
how exceedingly I was broken into tears, and which continued with me on the road;
how all my prospects closed up after getting into this house,
so that David Sands had to wait for me until morning;
the many baptisms I then passed through in this eastern country,
and also how marvellously my way opened to go home,
and the sweet peace I enjoyed for giving up to the service, together with prospects,
conflicts and exercises endured since, in Carolina and England,
and now of late continued.
I fell prostrate in humble acknowledgment to the great Author of all good,
thanked him for mercy and deliverances past,
and supplicated with brokenness of heart for the
continuation of support in all the future:
it was a day to be recorded,
of release and relief After dinner we had a remarkable
opportunity with the family and two other Friends,
and parted in great nearness, and accompanied by Paul Rogers,
proceeded to William Brown's at Dover.

"`20th.--To a meeting at Dover, appointed for Friends only,
which was an open satisfactory time.
Dined at M. Osburn's, and then rode to Seabrook, twenty-two miles.

"`21st.--After breakfast sat down with this family and
had a solid time--the labour fell on me.
I felt engaged to supplicate, and was very peaceful and easy on the way to Salem,
thirty-two miles; where we arrived about the fourth hour, and put up at our kind friends,
Matthew and Betsey Purington's.

"`22nd, first-day.--To Salem meeting, both morning and afternoon:
in the first I had a pretty relieving, satisfactory time.
I was favoured, I thought, in the afternoon, both in testimony and supplication.
We drank lea at A. Chase's.

"`23rd, second-day.--We rode to Boston, accompanied by William Brown, Jr.,
and Betsey Purington.
Put up at John Fry's, near the meeting-house,--an old man about eighty,
who lives in an ancient habitation.
He received us kindly, and we had a parting opportunity with him and his family.

"`26th.--To Smithfield monthly meeting, which was a satisfactory time;
I had a sweet opportunity after a solid pause in the close of the meeting for business.
We dined at Walter Allen's, and then moved on about four miles, to R. Southwick's,
and lodged.

"`27th.--To Uxbridge monthly meeting, held at North Bridge;
silent suffering and exercise were my portion throughout.

"`28th.--To Uxbridge, where we had a satisfactory time,
and in the evening went to Providence with our kind friends, Obadiah Brown and wife.

"`29th, first-day.--To meeting at Providence, morning and afternoon.

"`30th.--To Greenwich monthly meeting.
This was a remarkable meeting throughout; they looked and felt like Friends,
and conducted the business with weight.
We had a very sweet opportunity with a young man, who was invited into the meeting;
just at the close of the business, on the men's side of the house, I told Friends,
that if the women had done theirs, it would be pleasant to have the shutters opened.
They were, and we both had a relieving time; Susanna Horne in testimony,
and I in supplication, and the meeting closed sweetly.
After visiting a sick Friend returned back to Obadiah Brown's.

"`Tenth month 1st, third-day.
A meeting is appointed at six o'clock this evening for the inhabitants of Providence.
Dined at Moses Brown's: I rode with him in his chaise,
and when we came in sight of his house,
my mind was affected in remembrance of past occurrences.
O how marvellous are the changes to be met with--yesterday I was greatly favoured,
was light and easy after so good a meeting;
this afternoon the sense and weight of death and darkness overspread.
I walked out and could have fallen prostrate on the earth,
if it would have been of any avail.
Went to the evening meeting low and tried here my female companion had a singular time,
and near the close I ventured to express a little of what impressed my mind,
and felt more easy.

"`2nd.--To a meeting appointed at Smithfield.
I rode with Moses Brown: it was a small meeting, and a low time in the beginning;
and for most of the time I thought there was no labour for me; but a little arose,
and I expressed it, and felt relief.
Dear Susanna followed; more light, life and comfort sprang up,
and under a sense of it my soul bowed in thankfulness, and had, before the close,
to acknowledge it in prayer: had a sweet ride back to Providence.
How different the feelings of my exercised mind, to what they were most of yesterday.

"`3rd, fifth-day.--After breakfast, and an opportunity with Obadiah Brown and family,
which was a tendering one, we went to Cumberland meeting, eleven miles:
this little company appear to be most of them convinced ones.
Several serious people dined with us at D. Metcalf's, near the meeting-house.
After which we went to Samuel Smith's, twelve miles, and lodged,
accompanied by Obadiah Brown.

"`4th.--To Mendon meeting, three miles.
It was long in gathering, and rather trying,
but closed solidly--Susanna Horne appeared in supplication.
In the afternoon rode to Worcester, eighteen miles,
after an opportunity with the family we dined with.

"`6th, first-day.--To Leicester meeting, which was pretty satisfactory:
dined at P. Earle's, after which had an opportunity.
Set off accompanied by Obadiah Brown, and got lost,
but after riding about ten miles we put up at a very comfortable inn.

"`7th.--Left this place early, and rode twelve miles to another inn,
where we had a religious opportunity with the inn-keeper's family.
Alter breakfast proceeded, and on our way stopped to get some refreshment,
and had a sitting with a pretty large family; after which we rode to E. Cook's,
at Pelham, and met a kind reception.

"`8th.--A rainy day, and but few Friends at meeting,
and the other part of the company mostly raw looking people--a
number of women and girls without bonnets or caps.
We set, I believe, more than two hours in a very trying, cloudy silence,
and being near breaking up, E. Cook spoke a few words; 'That although Paul might plant,
and Apollos water,
it was God who gave the increase;' after which a little more sprang up in my mind,
and an opening to minister, which, though trying work, was some relief to me.

"`10th.--To a large meeting at Richmond, which proved an open time.
We both had relieving service;
and supplication was offered for the extension of mercy and kindness to New England,
and thanksgiving for preservation in it.
Now we felt a release,
this being the last meeting within that yearly meeting which we are likely to attend.

"`11th.--To Rockingham, twenty-three miles, and dined, which was a pleasant ride.
This afternoon we rode eighteen miles over a turnpike through a wilderness country,
at least it appeared so, though we saw here and there a farm.
We put up before night at an inn in Cavendish, a pretty village.

"`12th.--Arose this morning, as we did yesterday, by candle light;
got our breakfast and rode twelve miles to Clark's inn, called Mount Holly.
I may with thankfulness, record this morning's ride, as being sweet and comfortable.
Got to Stephen Rogers' in a pretty heavy rain, where we met a hearty reception.

"`13th, first-day.--After breakfast I walked to a woods on the hill,
and opposite to a high mountain: here my mind was brought into a calm,
and faith granted to believe I was here in the will of my God,--when desires arose,
that from henceforth in travels through this yearly meeting, his will manifested in me,
may be done by me, and thereby prove my sanctification.
Thanks be rendered for the renewed extension of mercy and favour.

"`To Danby meeting; and previous thereto,
felt liberty to encourage Stephen Rogers to mention our
being likely to attend it this day week.
Some close exercise, and also labour, fell to my share.
In the afternoon I had a very deep plunge, and for a time I was fearful it was all wrong,
and that I had been too presuming; and yet, on examination, could not accuse myself.
Was helped by Stephen Rogers in conversation in the evening.

"`14th.--Felt easy to have a meeting appointed at Wallingford, about eight miles off.
This meeting was held in a Presbyterian house, at two o'clock.
Our friends thought it was a satisfactory one,
and we came back a few miles and lodged at N. Lapham's.

"`15th.'--After breakfast went to Joseph Button's,
and concluded to have notice given of our intention of being at Granville tomorrow,
Pollet fifth-day, and Dorset sixth day.

16th.--There were but few of the neighbours came to the meeting at Granville,
and to me it was a distressing time, we were both silent,
A company came in and staid some time, when one of them said, 'Let's go,
it's near dinner time,' etc.
It was preparative meeting, at the close of which we had the shutters opened,
and a pretty good time with Friends.

"`17th.--To Pollet, and had a meeting in the Presbyterian meeting-house:
here the labour fell altogether on me, a poor stripped creature.
We dined at a friendly man's, belonging to the congregation, where came three men,
and had considerable conversation on points of doctrine;
to one of whom Stephen Rogers related a remarkable circumstance respecting an Indian.
The Indian wanted a pipe of tobacco,--one in company
put his hand in his pocket and gave him some.
The Indian turned away to fill his pipe and discovered a a small piece of silver among it.
The Indian expressed himself afterwards nearly in this manner, to some company;
'Two men talk in my breast, the good man and the bad man; the good man say.
Carry the silver back; the man that had it did not mean to give you the silver.
The bad man say.
You fool what is freer than a gift, and you can buy a dram with it;
but the good man speak again, and says.
Do as you would be done by; the man did not mean to give you the silver.
Then I thought I would sleep upon it,
hoping I should be left quiet in my mind about the silver;
but I could not sleep--the two men talk so to me all night long:
in the morning I was made willing to carry back the silver, then I found peace.'
Stephen Rogers then said to one of the most zealous and talkative,
'Take this home with you, and weigh it carefully in your own mind, and when prepared,
I should be glad to see you at my house,
and inform me whether there can be found a better guide and director in any man,
than that which the poor savage Indian found.
We proceeded several miles to Dorset,
and put up at Sylvester Cheeseborough's. It was rather a trying evening;
my spirits were sunk before we got into this Friend's house, and I had a sleepless night,
many things crowding in upon my mind, so that I almost wished to be at home.

"`18th.--Went to a meeting held in an unfinished house,
where Susanna Horne had an enlarged opportunity, and I felt very content in silence.
We all dined at Sylvester Cheeseborough's, and afterwards had a religious opportunity.

"`19th.--Felt a sweet calm on waking; but why not give thanks for trials,
seeing the trial of our faith is precious: 'In every thing give thanks,
for such is the will of God concerning you.'

"`20th, first-day,--To a very large and satisfactory meeting at Danby,
where were many youth, I feel thankful we have got through this arduous week's exercise.
A large company came to see us in the evening,
amongst whom we had a religious opportunity.

"`21st.--Accompanied by Stephen Rogers, we rode this day to Cambridge.
Put up at Dr. Smith's, whose wife is a member:
here we met with a kind and hospitable reception.
Not long after we arrived,
two serious neighbours came in and spent a part of the evening with us,
having heard that some strangers were come;
they supposed it was Esther Griffin and Hannah Field, who, on their way to Canada,
lately visited families at White creek, about eight miles from here,
and had extended some visits to families not Friends, in or near this place.
Before these men left, we proposed a meeting, which was approved of.

"`22nd, third-day.--I feel placid and quiet in my present circumstance;
let us then wait for further manifestations of our heavenly Father's will,
and when favoured with them, cheerfully obey.
We had an opportunity with this family after we dined, and proceeded two miles,
to what is called the Checkered Inn, where the meeting was held in a large upper chamber.
It was filled with people, and was a satisfactory time, manifestly so,
by what was expressed at the close, as also the affectionate behaviour of the people.
The two friendly men who visited us last evening obtained this place to hold the meeting,
and it evidently appeared they took much pains to get their neighbours together.

"`23rd.--To Cambridge meeting, held in a school house, which was but a low time.
We had a sitting with this family and then rode to J. Dillingham's, at Easton, and lodged.

"`24th.--The remains of an ancient Friend named Gifford,
were buried before the meeting at Easton.
The company came into the meeting, which was mostly made up of Friends,
and it was a good time.
We returned to J. Dillingham's,
and had a comfortable sitting with his large family in the evening,
and felt much united to both parents and children.

"`25th.--Crossed the river and attended meeting at Saratoga, held for Friends only,
which was a singular time.

"`26th, seventh-day.--We rode to Troy: we were informed that twenty-six years ago,
there was only the ferry house and another in Troy.

"`27th, first-day.--To meeting in Troy;
and my mind singularly exercised with fears that all present did not
walk and act in the true faith once delivered to the saints,
and had a relieving time.
At the close we appointed a public meeting, to be held at six o'clock;
which was an unsettled, trying, dull one to me--I felt entirely shut up.
'If another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.'

"`28th.--We could not get off according to expectation and desire this morning,
and so staid until after dinner,
before which had a religious opportunity with J. G. Proceeded to Albany,
where a clever little company assembled in the evening,
and we encouraged them to consider whether it would not be right to sit together,
and keep up a meeting in this place.

"`29th.--After breakfast crossed the river at Albany and rode to Henry Marriott, Jr.'s,
about twenty miles, and after a religious opportunity proceeded to Klinykill.

"`30th.--To Klinykill meeting, which was rather a laborious time.
We dined at A. Macey's,
and after a religious time with this large
family returned to Henry Marriott's and lodged;
here we had a religious opportunity before we retired.

"`31st.--Went to Hudson meeting, which was a solid, comfortable season.

"`Eleventh month 2nd.--Susanna Horne and companions set off for Nine Partners.
I tried it until our chaise was brought to the door,
and did not feel easy to leave this town.
After they left me we crossed the river to Athens, and went to John Alsop's:
while sitting there my thoughts were turned to
another family whose names I had heard mentioned,
and was free to go, and so went on from place to place,
until we visited all the families except one, being twelve in number.

"`3rd, first-day.--To meeting, and had a satisfactory, open time, much as last fifth-day.

After dinner went to visit the halt and maimed.

"`On the 4th, accompanied by several Friends, we rode to Henry Hull's,
and on the 5th attended the select meeting at Nine Partners,
where we met with David Sands and wife.
It was a low time with me on the way to meeting this morning,
but I was raised up before it closed;
dear David being favoured to speak feelingly to my state, and I thought to my companion,
Susanna Horne's also, whom we met again at this place.
Dined at Isaac Thorn's,
and afterwards paid a visit to the Yearly meeting boarding school;
went through the different rooms among the children,
and had a meeting with them and the family in the evening.

"`6th, fourth-day.--To Nine Partners quarterly meeting, which was a favoured,
good time throughout.

"`7th.--To Stanford, to Henry Hull's, and walked to meeting,
which was a remarkable time of instruction and favour,--back and dined,
and drank tea at John Hull's, with many Friends,
and afterwards had a religious opportunity.

"`8th.--The quarterly meeting at Stanford was a remarkably favoured time.

"`9th.--To an appointed meeting at Pleasant Valley, which was small,
but a favoured season.

"`10th.--To meeting at Poughkeepsie, which was held in an upper room in a dwelling house.
In the evening to an appointed meeting in the court house, which was large,
and a quiet favoured season.

"`11th.--This morning David Sands and wife accompanied us to Marlborough,
where we had a satisfactory meeting.

"`12th.--To a meeting appointed at the Valley,
after which we rode to D. Birdsall's. I felt pilgrim-like on riding up to this house.
The hearty reception of this Friend measurably healed me.

"`13th.--After breakfast sat down with this large family and had a comfortable time.
Proceeded to Newburg, which I suppose is the spot where the American army lay,
when David Brooks and myself passed through it thirty-five years ago.
We had a meeting in the court house, which was very small, but a comfortable,
instructive season.
In the afternoon rode on to David Sands',
where we were received with much affectionate kindness, and spent the evening pleasantly.

"`14th.--To meeting, which was large, and an open, satisfactory season;
much so it appeared to dear David Sands and wife.

"`15th, sixth-day.--After a very solemn time in the family,
wherein near sympathy was felt, we proceeded to an inn, about thirty-two miles.

"`16th.--Set off about day light on our journey.
At Sussex court house we got directions about the way, which appeared not to be correct.
We got lost in the woods, and after riding several miles out of our way, we met two men,
who directed us across the country to an inn, where we were set right,
and arrived at our friend E. Wilson's, at Hardwick, near dusk.
This may be received as a favour throughout;
for if we had tarried in the morning one hour, and the same circumstance, happened,
we might have been in the woods all night.

"`17th, first-day.--To meeting at Hardwick, which was larger than I expected,
and an open, encouraging time; several, after meeting, appeared glad to see me.
We went home with G. Wilson.

"`18th.--Arose before day, and after we had eaten, had a comfortable,
encouraging time with this lovely family.
We moved on and got to our friend Henry Clifton's, at Kingwood, about sunset.
We rode through that part of the country which David Brooks and I did thirty years ago.
I remembered the stop we made at Watson's, whose house stood on a hill,
and before the door a very fine spring issued:
this was the place I first ventured to go down in awful supplication in public.
The precious feelings I had at that time, are remembered by me this day,
and how marvellously I have been led about since; 'I am not worthy,' said Jacob,
on his journey back to his father's house; and so said I.

"`19th.--Some more light, ease and comfort this morning.
It was in Bucks county I began in the work of the ministry, and then came to this place;
a little similar to Elisha following Elijah.
The Lord preserve my dear aged friend and brother, David Brooks, unto the end,
and protect me in and through all yet to be met with: preserve me in integrity, Amen,
The meeting was larger than I expected, and a season of much encouragement.
Dined at Henry Clifton's,
and after it paid an acceptable visit to his brother William and family.

"`20th.--To Benjamin Clark's, Stonybrook; rode about thirty miles in the rain.

"`21st.--To Stonybrook meeting, which was a close, searching time.
Dear Susanna Horne prayed for them, and on the whole it was satisfactory.
In the evening had a religious opportunity:
the Lord is to be waited on for fulfilling his own will and purpose.

"`22nd.--To Dr. Taylor's, accompanied by Benjamin Clark; here we met a kind reception.
It is a day of exercise,
having written home respecting an opening to engage in
a family visit in the Northern district.

"`23rd.--To meeting at East Branch, +++[+++Robbins']; a favoured time.
Benjamin Clark staid with us, and I thought, had a good time near the close; indeed,
the meeting throughout was to my admiration.

"`24th, first-day.--To Crosswicks meeting, and favoured with an open season,
to satisfaction.

Second and third-days, attended Burlington quarterly meeting,
and on fourth-day evening arrived at my own habitation, a little after night,
and found my family in health.`"

In the twelfth month of this year,
he visited the families of the Northern district monthly meeting, to which he belonged,
in company with his friend Susanna Horne; and after this was accomplished,
a similar visit was made to the families of Philadelphia monthly meeting,
both of which were to the peace of his own mind, and the edification of the visited.

He remarks, in relation to these visits;
"`O the deep descendings I have experienced this last winter,
both on my bed and in families, and since.
While sitting in one of them, about third month 26th, of this year, 1812,
the very same prospects respecting the renewings
of hostilities on the continent of Europe,
opened and spread over my exercised mind, as did in the last conflict with Austria,
fourth month 2nd, 1809; and I know not how to record it better,
than to transcribe what Ezekiel mentions: 'Also, son of man, appoint you two ways,
that the sword of the king of Babylon may come:
both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose a place,
choose it at the head of the way to the city,' etc, etc, to the end.`"

Fifth month 12th, first-day, 1812.--He thus writes;
"`The descendings of my soul into darkness and the deeps, has been humblingly great,
and my trials such, as almost to induce me to entertain a belief I am forsaken.
I have queried again and again, why it should be so,
if I am indeed not cast off and out of mind of my heavenly Father; then surely I have,
must have, fellowship with such who have lived in dens and caves of the earth;
or with the prophet, who was fed by the ravens,
and travelled in the strength of the sustenance his Lord and Master ministered to him,
until he arrived at his destined place; where, after those alarming seasons of fire,
wind, and earthquake, he stood in the entrance of the cave,
wrapped his head in his mantle, and heard your voice, O Lord, intelligibly once more,
and was further commissioned in your blessed service.
O Lord, my God, my helper hitherto, you favoured me in New England,
and also in the late exercise gone through,
in the families of my fellow members and others.
If, at any time, your servant exceeded, forgive; and wash and purify me,
and make me more clean and pure: keep me in patient resignation to your will,
and be graciously pleased to open my state and condition once more to me;
but yet in your time, not mine; and your will be done.`"

The latter part of the year 1812, and the beginning of 1813,
he was engaged in a visit to the families of Friends
belonging to the Southern district monthly meeting,
Philadelphia, in company with Susanna Horne and her companion, Mary Allinson,
and Jonathan Evans; which he remarks, was a closely exercising time.

In the fifth month, 1813, he accompanied Susanna Horne to Bristol and Trenton meetings,
and back to Burlington.
He remarks, respecting this visit;
"`I was under great discouragement respecting going this little tour,
and hardly knew how to leave home, several circumstances combining to hinder.
But after setting out I felt comfortable, and may record, that the 17th,
and second-day of the week, was a day of days.
On my way to Trenton I had not a sensation of pain, either in body or soul;
and in the ride back in the afternoon, both the heavens above and the earth beneath,
to my outward view, were beautiful, cheering and pleasant;
and may I not venture to record, that such a holy sweetness and peace spread over all,
that it was as heaven upon earth to me.
I returned home peaceful, and with a sufficient reward,
which with thankfulness is recorded.`"

On the 15th of the sixth month following, he writes: "`To meeting, but all closed up,
and has been pretty much so of late;
yet not without some little peep through the cloud at times.
It is trying to live in death, and yet I crave ability so to do;
for man can do nothing aright, without Christ his Lord.
I say in secret oftentimes, in low places,
O when will my poor travailing soul know more of an emancipation from fetters,
bonds and chains.
I long for ability to serve God with greater freedom; but why should I desire even this,
so desirable, if it is not safe for me.
I might be in danger of taking the precious jewels of peace and liberty,
and play the harlot with them.
You, O my heavenly Father, know best what is best for me.
This I crave of you, to be enabled to fulfil your will in suffering: 'Sigh, therefore,
you son of man, with the breaking of your loins;
and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.' Ezekiel 21:6.
Why did this exercised prophet sigh?
'For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt,
and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint,
and all knees shall be weak as water: behold?
it comes, and shall be brought to pass, etc.'`"

In the seventh month of this year,
he went to New York to be with Susanna Horne and Elizabeth Coggeshall,
at the time of their embarking for England.
He says in relation to it; "`As I sat in our adjourned monthly meeting, sixth month 29th,
after many tears of contrition, I felt an opening,
accompanied with a degree of sweetness, to go to New York.

"`Seventh month 7th.--Attended the monthly meeting of New York,
which was a remarkable time.
Susanna Horne opened the service, Elizabeth Coggeshall followed,
and I bent in supplication.

"`11th, first-day.--Orders were given to go to the ship,
which had dropped down to the watering place, seven or nine miles off.
Samuel Emlen +++[+++Jr.], John Warder, William Allinson and I, with several New York Friends,
accompanied them aboard.
Staid about an hour and a half with them, and parted with near sympathetic affection.`"
The next day he set off for home, where he arrived on the 13th.

In the twelfth month, 1813, he paid his last visit to West-town boarding school,
an institution in which he had long been deeply interested,
and where his labours had been blessed.
At this time he had some precious religious opportunities with the teachers and children,
both in the school rooms and at meeting.
In one of the former, his mind was led into close feeling with one of the teachers,
under an apprehension that she was called to the work of the ministry,
which he found it his place to communicate to her,
speaking in a very impressive manner on those words of our dear Lord to Peter;
"`Feed my sheep.`"

The event proved that his impressions were correct,
the Friend appearing in prayer at the meeting on the following fifth-day,
and being afterwards acknowledged as a minister in the Society of Friends.
Shortly after his return home he addressed the following letter to her:

Philadelphia, First month 5th, 1814.

Dear friend,

Your letter came to hand this day, and after perusing it,
I felt a portion of the same freedom you expressed, to set down and answer it;
for as in a glass face answers to face, so does the heart of man to man;
such salutations proceeding from exercised children in the heavenly Father's family,
brought forth by and through many baptisms, cannot fail to unite.
I have looked back at the little visit paid you at West-town with sweetness,
and the opportunity of expressing what impressed my mind in your school room;
and finding soon afterwards I was not mistaken, is one more seal, added to others,
graciously vouchsafed me.
I rejoiced over you in your appearance in the meeting and afterwards,
as much as I could have done for a new born babe; yes, more so; and as I perceive,
by your plaintive letter,
you are desirous of being preserved so as to abide in
that lot which your divine Master may apportion you,
and I have no doubt of the sincerity of your humbled soul,
it arises in my heart to encourage you to be faithful; remembering,
that it is the faithful who are to abound with blessings.
Remember, dear child, in all your movements in so weighty a work,
how it was with you that day, what carefulness to move aright.
Well then, be watchful, be vigilant;
wait in the assemblies of the Lord's people for
the same renewed touches of that live coal;
and after you have, through holy help, turned the fleece and tried it both wet and dry,
and feels the evidence of the requiring, then hesitate no longer,
and even if your going forth in the work may be in fear and
trembling--words thus spoken will reach the witness in others,
and by faithfulness your gift will be enlarged; and when it is so,
render all the praise to the great and bountiful giver: seek his praise,
and not the praise of men.
May the Lord preserve you in humility, reverence and fear, all the days of your life;
so wilt you have occasion to bless his holy Name.
This is written with fear and care, by no means to exalt the creature; but that,
as expressed above, you may be kept in lowliness and fear.
So craves for himself, and for you, your affectionate and sympathizing friend,

Thomas Scattergood.

Thomas Scattergood was taken sick on the night of the 20th of the Fourth month, 1814,
with typhus fever, which soon greatly prostrated his strength.
It was during the time of the yearly meeting,
the several sittings of which he had attended until fourth-day evening;
and in conversation with his son he expressed his satisfaction in believing,
that so far it had been owned by the overshadowing of heavenly good,
which he hoped might continue to be the case to the end; adding,
"`though I cannot be with you personally, my mind will be there,
with desires that best wisdom may direct you.`"
He made inquiry respecting a subject pending in the yearly meeting,
which occasioned much exercise to his mind, and remarked,
"`I fear there is too much of a disposition in many Friends of the present day,
to have liberty,
and to trample under foot the testimonies and judgment of our worthy predecessors.`"

On sixth-day evening the yearly meeting closed;
and he inquired cheerfully how the several subjects
which had engaged its attention since he left it,
had been disposed of; and manifested his satisfaction in hearing,
especially that our testimony against distilling
or using spirituous liquors had been revived,
and claimed weighty attention.

On seventh-day, a friend sitting by his bed side,
expressed that he felt his mind covered with a calming and peaceful solemnity;
on which Thomas took him by the hand and replied,
"`so do I--my mind is centered in quiet, peaceful resignation.`"

A friend calling to see him, in whom he was much interested,
he expressed his satisfaction in seeing her; saying,
"`I have much desired your preservation every way.
I hope you wilt be preserved in the innocency and sweetness.`"
Upon her remarking, that the great Shepherd of Israel was near him,
and she believed would be to the end, he replied with much animation,
"`He is near me--I feel quiet and sweet.`"

Although his weakness had much increased, so that he was scarcely able to help himself,
yet he wished to sit up out of bed;--and though the exertion evidently fatigued him,
yet he felt the change to be reviving to him.
He took food with a good relish,
and passed the night without any apparent change for the worse, until near morning,
when one of those sinking spells came on, which are so common in this disease.

One or other of his physicians were with him
pretty constantly through first-day the 24th,
and all was done for his relief which their skill and judgment dictated;
but his constitution was unable to sustain the load of disease,
and respond favourably to the remedies used.

In the afternoon he remarked in substance;
"`This is the last piece of the garment that is to be worked up,
and if I can be favoured to join the righteous of every generation, it will be enough.`"
Shortly after he said, "`I don't know that I have much to say for myself;
I leave it to the Lord, the Shepherd that sleeps not by day, nor slumbers by night,
who watches over his children, and over his flock.`"
On taking some drink, he remarked;
"`A cup of cold water in the name of a disciple is pleasant;`" and presently after,
"`I hope a righteous generation will be raised up and preserved as a seed.`"
Remaining a little while in silence, he added; "`O,
if we can but be favoured to take some of this love with us.`"
"`I have been thinking of Josiah Bunting;
and hope and believe he made a good end--it is
the end crowns all--I have nothing to boast of.`"

His vital powers now appeared to be fast sinking,
and his speedy departure was looked for; but reviving a little he said,
"`I do not expect I am going now, that is, suddenly,--if so,
it is hid from me among the rest of the Lord's secrets.
I have been baptized into many low places and raised up again.`"

After some time of silence, and when very near his close, he said with some emphasis,
"`I will lead them`"--and again "`O, who will stand?`"
He peacefully departed about twenty minutes after seven o'clock in the evening,
(24th of fourth month,
1814) in the 66th year of his age--having endeavoured
to serve his generation according to the will of God,
and been faithful in the occupancy of the gift bestowed upon him,
we have the consoling assurance, that he is numbered among those at the right hand,
and has received the welcome sentence, "`enter into the joy of your Lord.`"

'''

Testimony of the monthly meeting of Philadelphia, for the Northern District,
concerning Thomas Scattergood.

From the love we feel for the memory of this our dear friend,
and the continued sense we have of his fervent pious engagements,
it appears to be a duty to posterity to transmit some account of his life and conduct.

He was born in the city of Burlington, New Jersey,
of parents professing belief in the doctrines and
principles held by us as a religious Society:
his father dying while he was young, he was placed an apprentice in this city;
and though often sensible of the checks of divine grace, which condemns for sin,
he followed the inclination of his own corrupt will,
which led into estrangement from the path of peace;
till being in mercy visited with a humbling sense of his miserable condition,
he turned at the reproofs of instruction,
and submitting to the gentle manifestations of light upon his understanding,
was enabled to bear the cross of Christ,
and became qualified to extend advice and counsel to others.
Under those exercises, a sense of a call to the ministry of the gospel was,
in the wisdom and love of God, communicated to his mind;
but through great reluctance to yield to this awful work, he forbore for several years,
and thereby brought upon himself very deep distressing conflicts.
At length, while accompanying a Friend who had been here on a religious visit,
the impression of divine requiring being renewed upon him,
his mouth was opened with a few words in a religious meeting; and after his return,
he expressed at times in our religious assemblies,
a few sentences in a tender broken manner, much to the satisfaction of his friends;
and continuing steadfast under many baptisms and trials,
he was remarkably careful that no part of his conduct might lessen
the force of the doctrine which he had to preach to others.
Keeping faithful to the intimations of duty,
he became prepared for more extensive service;
and with the concurrence of the monthly meeting,
proceeded to fulfil a prospect he had of a religious visit to
the meetings of Friends within the government of New York,
and part of New England, and was favoured to return with the reward of peace.
Thus diligently labouring in the work of the ministry,
he was for many years much from home, visiting meetings in various places,
particularly in Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina;
where he experienced much close exercise and proving of faith and patience;
but through the goodness and power of the blessed Shepherd of Israel,
whose help is ever near for the support of his humble dedicated servants,
he was carried through all, to the comfort of his own mind,
and the satisfaction of his friends.

The prospect of making a visit to the churches in Europe being opened upon his mind,
and meekly abiding under the weight of this exercise
until it was ripe for the information of his friends,
he was induced to spread it before them; and obtaining their unity and sympathy,
he embarked, and arrived in England in the year 1794.
Much deep and silent exercise was often his lot,
but as resignation and patience were maintained,
he was enabled to discharge what appeared to be his duty;
and labouring for several years in the fulfilment of this arduous service,
he experienced the near unity and fellowship of Friends in those countries,
and came away in the enjoyment of peace,
under a sense of the immediate protecting providence of Him,
who is to his children a sure rock and never-failing refuge.
He continued mostly at home for several years,
diligently attending the respective meetings of which he was a member,
and also other religious services.

He was much devoted to the promotion of the cause of truth and righteousness,
and through the efficacy of heavenly love, was at times enabled to say,
it was more to him than his necessary food;
but being sensible of his various infirmities, he was frequent in inward retirement,
and hence his mind became strengthened in watchfulness against those things which
interrupt the aspiration of the soul towards the Fountain of everlasting life;
being thereby made quick in the fear of the Lord, he increased in solid experience,
and gradually advanced in the way and work of salvation.
His example in silent waiting in our religious meetings was instructive,
and in the exercise of his gift,
it was evident that he had been careful to feel the putting forth of the divine hand,
being at times eminently endued with a clear
discernment of the states of meetings and individuals,
and in the power of the gospel,
was made instrumental to baptize many into deep contrition,
through a heartfelt sense of their own condition.
Thus, as a scribe well instructed into the kingdom,
he brought forth out of the treasury things new and old,
to the edification of the body and to the praise of its ever adorable head.

His sympathy with the afflicted was often manifest;
and the situation of those in necessitous circumstances
peculiarly claiming his tender regard,
occasioned his frequently bringing to the notice of his brethren,
their suffering condition,
that their benevolent endeavours might be exerted for their alleviation.

He was so tender of the reputation of all,
that he could not take the liberty of expressing anything to lessen it,
nor was he easy to hear others in such a practice.

He attended several sittings of our yearly meeting in the fourth month, 1814,
and was taken unwell the 21st. The disorder though
apparently not alarming at the commencement,
in a short time greatly prostrated his strength:
yet he was preserved throughout in much quietness and sweetness of spirit;
was frequently pleasant and cheerful;
his concern for the prosperity of Zion was still the prevalent engagement of his mind,
and he often enquired how the yearly meeting was advancing in its important business.

On the third day of his illness,
a friend sitting by him expressed he felt a peaceful solemnity--he replied, "`So do I;
my mind is centered in quiet, peaceful resignation.`"
On the next day those about him apprehended he was near departing, but reviving a little,
he at intervals expressed nearly as follows;
"`This is the last piece of the garment that is to be worked up;
and if I can be favoured to join the righteous of every generation, it will be enough.`"
Again--"`Well, I don't know that I have much to say for myself; I leave it to the Lord,
the Shepherd that sleeps not by day nor slumbers by night,
who watches over his children and over his flock:`" Again:
"`I hope that a righteous generation will be raised up
and preserved as a seed`"--and after a silent pause,
added, "`Oh,
if we can but be favoured to take some of that love
with us--the end crowns all--I have nothing to boast of;
I have been baptized into many low places, and raised up again.`"
He appeared disposed for more expression,
but his bodily powers were so far gone as to render his attempts unintelligible;
yet after a considerable time of silence, he uttered with much emphasis,
"`I will lead them.`"
Soon after which he quietly and peacefully departed, the 24th of the fourth month, 1814;
and we doubt not has entered into rest,
enjoying that crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
will give unto all them that love his appearing.
